Expenses such as \nfood, clothing, mortgage or rent, insurance, taxes, medical \ncosts, credit card payments, education expenses, and other \nconsumer debt are part of the farm plan calculations. Know your \ncosts. Bring your records with you.  \n\u2022 Remember to bring any financial records, which can include tax \nreturns, for the most recent production cycle to assist in \nprojecting the cash flow for your loan proposal. If you need to \nrely on off -farm income to repay the loan, bring in your last few \npay stubs.  \n\u2022 Bring copies of any written leases to the office with you if you \nare leasing land or equipment.  \n\u2022 It is a prudent idea to check your credit report before appl ying \nfor a loan. This allows you to spot any errors or research events \nthat may have negatively impacted your credit. The Fair Credit \nReporting Act (FCRA) requires each of the nationwide credit \nreporting companies \u2014 Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion \u2014 to \nprovide you with a free copy of your credit report, at your \nrequest, once every 12 months. The FCRA promotes the \naccuracy and privacy of information in the files of the nation\u2019s \ncredit reporting companies. The Federal Trade Commission \n(FTC), the nation\u2019s co nsumer protection agency, enforces the \nFCRA with respect to credit reporting companies.  \nMinority and Women Farmers and \nRanchers ", "doc_id": "933f0b35-e016-41ef-8366-1169b1e7ffa4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d252acdb2bc58e816ea3b263b2fbca5a8f16b31cb56545a400fc412a95401799", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q3dpihoeNMz2V-KgWNUEESpTtpdUkJZi/view", "title": "USDA Loan Description.pdf", "page": 36}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1959}, "relationships": {"1": "a248b797-f44f-4c17-897e-dec4f807498e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8dee22e-58e8-415c-b312-fc77625315e9": {"__data__": {"text": "While FSA is committed to serving all farmers and ranchers, by \nstatute, FSA targets a portion of all Guaranteed loan  funds, Direct \nOperating  and Direct Farm Ownership  loan funds, Microloan funding, \nand Youth loans, to historically underserved farmers and ranchers, \nwhich include:  \n\u2022 Women  \n\u2022 African -Americans \n\u2022 Alaskan Natives  \n\u2022 American Indians  \n\u2022 Hispanics  \n\u2022 Asians  \n\u2022 Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  \nResources \n\u2022 Fact Sheet: Loans for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and \nRanchers  ( PDF, 5 47 KB)  \n\u2022 Direct Loan Making Handbook 3- FLP (PDF, 2.5 MB)  \n\u2022 Annie's Project  \n\u2022 Alaska Native Knowledge Network  \n\u2022 Intertribal Agriculture Council  \n\u2022 Latino Economic Development Center  \n\u2022 Minority Landowner Magazine  \n\u2022 National Hmong American Farmers  \n\u2022 National Women in Agriculture Association  \n\u2022 Farmers.gov  \n \nLoan Types  \n\u2022 Direct Operating Loan  \n\u2022 Direct Farm Ownership Loan  \n\u2022 Microloan  \n ", "doc_id": "d8dee22e-58e8-415c-b312-fc77625315e9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "39ca505ef809133b627dbe66024f1eeccf93d01c40d0f093315b8d9d7f1c74c9", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q3dpihoeNMz2V-KgWNUEESpTtpdUkJZi/view", "title": "USDA Loan Description.pdf", "page": 37}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 931}, "relationships": {"1": "ef98c123-de9c-4e57-9f1e-bd2afb7cd6c2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3504b0e7-cfe2-498b-b287-0a2a161c63f3": {"__data__": {"text": "Loan Types  \nLoans to historically underserved and women farmers and ranchers \nare not a special type of loan program or loan type.
