Email: HQ.OSBDC@sba.gov   \n \n1.2 Introduction   \nSBA seeks to make grants under the SBDC P ortable Assistance Project to SBDC Lead \nCenters serving economically distressed areas.  Projects under this award must provide \ntechnical assistance and/or training services to small businesses in communities that \nare economically impacted as a result of a recent business or government facility down -\nsizing or closing, known as a \u201cQualifying Event.\u201d  The Qualifying Event(s) must \ndemonstrate negative impacts of job losses or small business instability in the SBDC \nService Area.  The goals and objectives of a su ccessful application must demonstrate \nan increase in small business success and viability through such measures as job \ncreation and retention, increases in sales, business starts, and capital infusion.  \n \nSBA is particularly interested in collaborative effor ts (community, regional, statewide, \nindustry sector, etc.) that may serve as best practices and models of such small \nbusiness assistance.  Applicants are encouraged to design and develop innovative \nprograms and services to address the purpose of this Proje ct.  Portable Assistance \nprojects must be aimed generally at helping current and prospective small businesses in \nan area affected by a Qualifying Event, with a scope of work comprising a general \nproject to boost entrepreneurship in the affected area.  Effo rts funded under this \nannouncement may also produce products and methodologies that can be replicated by \nSBDCs in other locations nationwide.  \n \n1.3 Background   \nSince its inception in 1953, SBA has served to aid, counsel, assist and protect the \ninterests of small businesses.  While SBA is best known for its financial support of small \nbusinesses through its lending programs, the Agency also plays a critical role in  \nproviding funding to organizations that deliver technical assistance in the form of \ncounseling and training to small business concerns and nascent entrepreneurs in order \nto promote growth, expansion, innovation, increased productivity and management \nimpro vement.  The mission of SBA\u2019s Office of Small Business Development Centers \n(OSBDC),  which bears responsibility for administering the Portable Assistance  \nProgram, is to provide assistance to the small business community by linking the \nresources of federal, state and local governments with the resources of the educational \ncommunity and the private sector.  In partnership with SBA\u2019s OSBDC and district \noffices, the SBDCs develop programs and provide business management and other \nservices that enhance the econom ic development goals and objectives of their \nrespective  states, their local funding partners and SBA.

Find out your institution's DUNS number  \nAll institutions applying for federal grants are required to \nprovide a DUNS number. The federal government has \nadopted the use of DUNS numbers to keep track of how \nfederal grant money is dispersed.  \nAsk your grant administrator or chief financial officer to \nprovide your institution's DUNS number. Research \nuniversities and most colleges, independent libraries, and \nlarge institution s already have DUNS numbers.  \nIf your institution doesn't have a DUNS number, call the \nspecial Dun & Bradstreet hotline at 1 -866-705-5711 to \nreceive one free of charge.  \nMore information about DUNS numbers is available at :  \nhttp://fedgov.dnb.com/webform . You will receive a \nDUNS number at \nthe conc lusion of \nthe phone call.  Record and \nprotect your \nDUNS \nnumber and \nhave it \navailable for \nquick \nreference in \nthe following \nsteps.  \n2.  Register your institution with System of Award \nManagement (SAM)  \nSAM is a government -wide registry for institution s that seek \ngrants from or otherwise do business with the federal \ngovernment. SAM will house your institution al information, \nallowing Grants.gov to verify your identity and to pre -fill \ninstitution al information on your grant applications. Ask \nyour chief fi nancial officer, grant administrator, or \nauthorizing official if your institution  is already registered \nwith SAM.  \nRemember that registration with the System of Award \nManagement must be confirmed each year for your \nGrants.gov registration to remain valid.  \nIf your institution  is not registered, you can register online at \nwww.sam.gov  or apply by phone  at:   \n866-606-8220 . \nWhen your institution  registers with SAM, you must \ndesignate:   \n1)  SAM Point of Contact (SAM POC).  This individual is \nresponsible for maintaining the accuracy and timeliness of \nthe information in SAM's registry.  Upon successful \nregistration, SAM POC will receive a T -PIN (Trading \nPartner Identification Number) that will enable the SAM \nPOC to update your  institution 's SAM information, as \nnecessary.  This is the most \ncumbersome st ep. \nWe recommend \nthat you allow up \nto 3 days to gather \ninformation and \nprepare the \napplication. After \nyou submit your \nregistration \ninformation, SAM \nwill send an e -mail \nconfirmat ion, \ngenerally on the \nsame day.  The SAM site \nuses \nterminology \nthat is geared \ntowards \nprofit -making \ninstitution s \nverses non-\nprofits. Do not \nbe confused \nby terms such \nas:  vendor, \ncontractor, \netc; only \nprovide the \nrequested \ninformation.  \nRecord and \nprotect your \nT-PIN and M -\nPIN.

In some cases, they\nrelate to general activities, such as preservation of the environment, while, in other cases they\nare integral to the purposes of the award-supported activities. An application funded with the\nrelease of federal funds through a grant award does not constitute or imply compliance with\nfederal statute and regulations. Funded organizations are responsible for ensuring that their\nactivities comply with all applicable federal regulation requirements.\n10. Standard Term - Executive Pay\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Pub. L.116-94) signed into law on December 20,\n2019, restricts the amount of direct salary to Executive Level II of the Federal Executive Pay\nscale. The Executive Level II salary per E.O. 13756, was increased to $199,300 effective January\n2021.\nThe law limits the salary amount that may be awarded and charged to SBA assistance\nagreements and cooperative agreements. Award funds may not be used to pay the salary of any\nindividual at a rate in excess of Executive Level II. This amount reflects an individual\u2019s base salary\nexclusive of fringe and any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of the\nduties to the applicant organization. This salary limitation also applies to\nsubawards/subcontracts under an SBA grant or cooperative agreement.\n11. Standard Term - Non-federal Entity Responsibilities\na.

The program was \nexpanded and made permanent in 2007 when the WBC Sustainability Grant Program, established in \n1999, was replaced with the WBC Renewal Grant Progr am.  \n1.3 Background  \nSince its inception in 1953, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has served to aid, counsel, assist \nand protect the interests of small businesses.  While the SBA is best known  for its financial support \nof small businesses through its many lending programs, the Agency also plays a critical role in \nproviding funding to organizations that deliver technical assistance in the form of counseling and \ntraining to small business concern s and nascent entrepreneurs in order to promote growth, \nexpansion, innovation, increased productivity and management improvement.   \nThe mission of the WBC Program is to act as the catalyst for providing in -depth, substantive, \noutcome -oriented business serv ices to women entrepreneurs, both nascent and established \nbusinesses, a representative number of which are socially and economically disadvantaged.  This \nmission is accomplished through the award of financial assistance to private, 501(c) - certified non -\nprofit organizations to enable them to affect substantial economic impact in their communities, as \nmeasured by successful business start -ups, job creation and retention, and increased company \nrevenues.

Email: Stanley.jonesjr @sba.gov  \n   \n1.2 Introduction \nThe overarching mission of the Office of Government Contracting and Business Development \n(\u201cGC  BD \u201d) is to assist small businesses to compete for Federal prime contract s and to secure \nsubcontracting opportunities from large businesses. Within the GCBD - , the Office of Business \nDevelopment's (BD\u2019s) specific mission is to execute activities authorized under Sections 8(a) and 7(j) \nof the Small Business Act . Under the former, SBA provides  business development assistance to firms \nthat are owned and controlled by economically and socially disadvantaged individuals.   Section 7(j) of \nthe Small Business Act authorizes the U.S. Small Business Administration ( \u201cSBA\u201d) to provide \nmanagement and technical assistance to eligible individuals and businesses.   \nTo be eligible for 7(j) services, a client must be:  a socially and economically disadvantaged individual \nwhose firm is a participant in the 8(a) Business Development Program; a business that is eligible to \nreceive 8(a) contracts; or a business which qualifies as small under 13 CFR subpart 121 \u2013 Small \nBusiness Size Regulations ; and that is located in an urban or rural area with a high proportion of \nunemployed or low -income individuals, or which is owned by such low -income individuals.  The \nterm \u201chigh proportion of unemployed\u201d means the urban or rural county's unemployment rate is not \nless than 140 percent of the average unemployment rate for the United States or for the State in \nwhich such county is located, whichever is less, based on the most recent data available in the  annual \nLocal Area Unemployment Statistics report from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor \nStatistics.  The term \"low -income individual\" means an individual whose family's taxable income for \nthe preceding year did not exceed 150 percent of the po verty level amount established by the Bureau \nof the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce, for determining poverty status.  \n As a component of BD, the Office of Management and Technical Assistance (\u201c OMTA \u201d) \nimplements the authority that section 7(j) of the Small Business Act (the \u201cAct\u201d ) vests  with SBA to \naward contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to private organizations to pay all or part of the \ncosts of services and projects that provide managemen t and technical assistance to eligible concerns.  \nAnnually, the 7(j) program reaches thousands of eligible businesses located throughout the United \nStates and its territories.  \nThe interstices of Sections 7(j) and 8(a) of the Act are filled in/   by SBA reg ulations found at Title 13 \nof the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 124.  These rules further define the purpose of \nthe 7(j) management and technical assistance program and define eligible recipients as individuals or \nconcerns eligible for assista nce under sections 7(a)(11), 7(j)(10), or 8(a) of the Act.

While SBA is best known for its financial supp ort of small businesses through its many \nlending programs, the Agency also plays a critical role in providing funding to organizations that \ndeliver technical assistance in the form of counseling and training to small business concerns and \nnascent entrepren eurs in order to promote growth, expansion, innovation, increased productivity and \nmanagement improvement.   \n \nThe mission of SBA\u2019s Office of Business Development, which bears responsibility for administering \nthe Management and Technical Assistance Program,  is to administer the section 8(a) program. This \nprogram offers business development assistance to over 9,000 small government contractors that, in \naddition to meeting other criteria, are certified by SBA as owned and controlled at least 51% by \nsocially an d economically disadvantaged individuals.   \n \nAs a component of BD, the Office of Management and Technical Assistance (OMTA) implements \nthe authority that section 7(j) of the Small Business Act vests with in SBA to award contracts, grants, \nor cooperative agr eements to private organizations to pay all or part of the costs of services and \nprojects that provide management and technical assistance to 8(a) program participants and other \nsocially and economically disadvantaged businesses, businesses located in area s of high \nconcentrations of unemployment or low -incomes, and businesses owned by low - income individuals.  \nAnnually, the 7(j) program reaches thousands of eligible businesses located throughout the United \nStates and its territories.  \nFor over four decades, these services have been secured from professional service providers, \neducational institutions, non -profit organizations and private corporations.

L. No. 106 -102 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901 note). The PRIME Act \nauthorizes the SBA Administrator to establish a program for the purposes of: (i) providing training and \ntechnical as sistance to disadvantaged entrepreneurs; (ii) providing training and capacity building \nassistance to microenterprise development organizations (MDOs) and programs; (iii) aiding in Research \nand development of best practices for microenterprise and technical  assistance programs for \ndisadvantaged entrepreneurs; and (iv) for other activities as the SBA Administrator determines.  \nThis year, SBA will give additional consideration to those applicants that (1) provide training and \ntechnical assistance to economicall y disadvantaged entrepreneurs in rural areas; and (2) training and \ntechnical assistance to support entrepreneurship in HubZones.  \n \n1.3 Background  \nSince its establishment in 1953, SBA has served to aid, counsel, assist and protect the interests of \nsmall business es.

Applicants are \nalso encouraged to collaborate with SBA District Offices; 7(j) Technical Assistance providers; Small \nBusiness Investment Companies; SBA Re source Partners (e.g. SCORE, Small Business Development \nCenters, and Veterans Business Outreach Centers); other federal, state, local and tribal government \nsmall business development programs and activities; universities, colleges, and other institutions o f \nhigher education; and private organizations such as chambers of commerce and trade and industry \ngroups and associations.  \n1.6 SBA Involvement and  Oversight  \nPRIME is managed by the indomitable Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO). One or more \ndesignated Grant Officer(s) Technical Representatives (GOTR(s)) within OEO will be responsible for \noverall monitoring and oversight of PRIME award recipients, including compliance with the terms of \nthe Notice of Award.

The program was \nexpanded and made permanent in 2007 when the WBC Sustainability Grant Program, establis hed in \n1999, was replaced with the WBC Renewal Grant Program.  \n1.3 Background  \nSince its inception in 1953, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has served to aid, counsel, assist \nand protect the interests of small businesses.  While the SBA is best known f or its financial support \nof small businesses through its many lending programs, the Agency also plays a critical role in \nproviding funding to organizations that deliver technical assistance in the form of counseling and \ntraining to small business concerns and nascent entrepreneurs in order to promote growth, \nexpansion, innovation, increased productivity and management improvement.   \nThe mission of the WBC Program is to act as the catalyst for providing in -depth, substantive, \noutcome -oriented business servic es to women entrepreneurs, both nascent and established \nbusinesses, a representative number of which are socially and economically disadvantaged.  This \nmission is accomplished through the award of financial assistance to private, 501(c) - certified non -\nprof it organizations to enable them to affect substantial economic impact in their communities, as \nmeasured by successful business start -ups, job creation and retention, and increased company \nrevenues.

SBA may also use social security numbers for the purpose of collecting and reporting on any delinquent fees or other amounts owed SBA.  Under the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 7701, \nthe applicant business and any guarantor of the loan are required to provide their social security numbers or other taxpayer identification numbers in order to do business with SBA. Failure to provide this information would affect your ability to obtain a 7(a) loan. For other individuals signing this application, the submission of the social security \nnumber is voluntary and failure to provide your social security number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to \nwhich you are entitled.  \n \nIn\n evaluating whether the applicant satisfies the criteria for a  7(a) loan, SBA considers whether the applicant and each  \nof its Associates possess good character. In making this determination, SBA considers the person\u2019s integrity, candor, \nand criminal history if any.  SBA is specifically authorized to verify your criminal history, or lack thereof, pursuant to \nsection 7(a)(1 )(B), of the Small Business Act, 15 USC Section 636(a)(1)(B). In addition, for all forms of assistance, \nSBA is authorized to make all investigations necessary to ensure that a person has not engaged in acts that violate or will violate the Small Business A ct, 15 U.S.C. 634(b)(11).  In conducting the criminal background check, SBA also \nuses your social security number to distinguish you from other individuals with the same or similar name or other personal identifier s. This use is permitted under Executive Order 9397.  \n \nR\noutine Uses : Some of the information collected may be checked against criminal history indices of the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation. When the information collected indicates a violation or potential violation of law, whether civil, \ncriminal, or administrative in nature, SBA may refer it to the appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local, or \nforeign, charged with responsibility for or otherwise involved in investigation, prosecution, enforcement or prevention of such violations. See SBA\u2019s Privacy Act System of Records, at 74 Fed.

SBA must \nobtain your taxpayer identification number when you apply for a loan. If you receive a loan, and do not make payments as they come due, SBA may take one or more of the following actions: (1) report the status of your  loan(s) or other debt owed to SBA to credit bureaus, (2) hire a collection agency to collect your loan or other delinquent debt, (3) offset your income tax refund or other amounts due to you from the Federal Government, (4) suspend or debar you or your company from doing business with the Federal Government, (5) refer your loan to the Department of Justice or other attorneys for litigation, or (6) foreclose on collateral or take other action permitted in the loan instruments. Finally, if you default on an SBA loan and fail to fully reimburse the Agency for any resulting loss, SBA may  refer you to the computer database of delinquent Federal debtors maintained by the Department of Housing and Urban Development or another Federal agency.

These changes will further \nimprove the review process for franchise, license, de aler, jobber or similar agreements ( collectively \nreferred to as \u201c franchise agreements\u201d) as currently set forth  in SBA\u2019s Standard Operating Procedure \n(SOP) 50 10 5( I). As further described below, the changes  will temporarily permit a 7(a) lender or \nCertifie d Development Company (CDC) to submit  a certification  from the franchisor  together with an \naddendum  previous ly negotiated with SBA in lieu of the SBA Addendum to Franchise A greement  \n(SBA Form 2462)  that is required under the current version of the SOP .  In addition, SBA has revised \nthe SBA Addendum to Franchise Agreement (SBA Form 2462) to, among other things, incorporate \nagreements other than \u201cfranchise agreements\u201d (e.g., license, dealer, jobber agreements).   \n \nEffective immediately and u ntil further notic e, SBA will accept either of the following as  \nsufficient to establish that a franchisee is not \u201caffiliated \u201d with a franchisor: (1) the revised SBA \nAddendum to Franchise Agreement; or (2) a C ertification ( in the form attached to this Notice) \ntogether with the franchisor\u2019s SBA negotiated addendum.  SBA also is making some additional \nchanges to the franchise review process to clarify the requirements for 7(a) lenders and CDCs.  \n \nBackground  \n \nIn order to be eligible for financial assistance under SBA\u2019s loan programs, a business must be \u201csmall .\u201d \nThe Small Business Act defines a small business as \u201cone which is independently owned and operated \nand which is not dominant in its field of operation.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 632. When a business is not independently owned and operate d, but is instead affiliated with another  business , SBA aggregate s the \nemployees, receipts or other measure of size of the business and all of its affiliates to determine whether the business  is small.  \n For businesses operating under a franchise agreement , SBA  regulations  state that SBA will find \naffiliation between a franchisor and franchisee if  the franchisee does not retain the right to profit from \nits efforts or bear the risk of loss commensurate with ownership.  13 CFR \u00a7 121.301(f)(5).   Over the years  SBA has reviewed various franchise agreements containing terms and conditions that impact \nthese criteria, and identified those that result ed in a finding of affiliation between the franchisor and \nfranchisee.

As a general rule, SBA \nconsiders agreements (or products, services or trademarks covered by such agreements) to be \u201ccritical\u201d when they account, individually or in the aggregate, for at least 67%  of the applicant\u2019s revenues.  \n   4.

The program was \nexpanded and made permanent in 2007 when the WBC Sustainability Grant Program, established in \n1999, was replaced with the WBC Renewal Grant Progr am.  \n1.3 Background  \nSince its inception in 1953, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has served to aid, counsel, assist \nand protect the interests of small businesses.  While the SBA is best known for its financial support \nof small businesses through its m any lending programs, the Agency also plays a critical role in \nproviding funding to organizations that deliver technical assistance in the form of counseling and \ntraining to small business concerns and nascent entrepreneurs in order to promote growth, \nexpa nsion, innovation, increased productivity and management improvement.   \nThe mission of the WBC Program is to act as the catalyst for providing in -depth, substantive, \noutcome -oriented business services to women entrepreneurs, both nascent and established \nbusinesses, a representative number of which are socially and economically disadvantaged.  This \nmission is accomplished through the award of financial assistance to private, 501(c) - certified non -\nprofit organizations to enable them to affect substantial econ omic impact in their communities, as \nmeasured by successful business start -ups, job creation and retention, and increased company \nrevenues.

Research \nuniversities and most colleges, independent libraries, and \nlarge institution s already have DUNS numbers.  \nIf your institution doesn't have a DUNS number, call the \nspecial Dun & Bradstreet hotline at 1 -866-705-5711 to receive \none free of charge.  \nMore information about DUNS numbers is available at :  \nhttp://fedgov.dnb.com/webform .

What is the legal authority for the SVOG Program? \nThe details of the SVOG program, as amended by the American Rescue Plan Act in March 2021, can be \nfound at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 9009a. \n2. What is an \u201celigible entity\u201d for an SVOG ? \nEligible entities may be live venue operators or promoters, theatrical producers, live performing arts \norganization operators, museum operators, motion picture theat re operators  or owners , and talent \nrepresentatives , per the Economic Aid Act . Additionally, entities of these types owned by state or \nlocal governments (for example, museums or historic homes) are eligible to apply if the government-\nowned entity acts solel y as a venue operator, museum, etc. and does not engage in other types of \nactivities.  \n \nFor example, a city parks and recreation department that operates a bandstand and separately \noperates various nature parks could apply as an eligible entity for the bandstand, but could not \ninclude the nature park entities.  \n  Finally, each subsidiary business owned by an eligible entity that also meets the eligibility \nrequirements in its own rights could apply  as an eligible entity.  \n3. When does a business have to have been established to be eligible to apply  for an SVOG?  \nThe business must have been in operation  as of February 29, 2020.  \n \n4. Is an entity that did not have revenue in 2019 but was conducting business operations on \nFebruary  29, 2020, eligible to apply  for an SVOG?  \nYes, if an entity did not have revenue in 2019 but was conducting business operations on Feb ruary  29, \n2020. Conducting business operations includ es incurring costs of necessary start -up and preparatory  \nactivities in the lead time before an anticipated opening date. The applicant must show the required \nearned revenue loss.  \n \n5. Is an entity  that applied for and received a Paycheck Protection Program loan before August 9, \n2020,  eligible to apply  for an SVOG?  \nYes. However, under the law, entities will be ineligible for a PPP loan AFTER they receive an SVOG.  \n \n6. Is an entity  that applied for a First Draw or Second Draw PPP loan on or after Dec ember 27, \n2020, eligible to apply  for an SVOG?    \nYes. However, under the law, entities will be ineligible for a PPP loan AFTER they receive an SVOG .  \n \n7. If an entity applied for a PPP loan after the American Rescue Plan Act became law but before the PPP application form was updated, is it still eligible for an SVOG even though the PPP \napplication included a certification saying the entity would not apply for an SVOG?  \nYes.  However, under the law, entities will be ineligible for a PPP loan AFTER they receive an SVOG.  \n ", "doc_id": "9f9c0fc7-e133-4a3a-ba84-b14986684115", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "58d342f4c63728de7467e974d5f48a2f74cc1210f9001042ffd35646b7c7fd2a", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o6swRJPStcdtGiakovvcFj2PGG57d6Q7/view", "title": "Copy of 10-20-21 SVOG FAQ FINAL_508_final.pdf", "page": 1}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2702}, "relationships": {"1": "3037b160-baf9-4c25-a377-7328984397ae"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff0fd392-80fd-4cd1-a4d2-dc4221e3f3c0": {"__data__": {"text": "3 | Page  8. How will receiving a PPP loan affect an eligible entity\u2019s SVOG award?  \nPer the American Rescue Plan Act, any entity that receives a PPP loan on or after Dec ember . 27, 2020 \n(whether First Draw or Second Draw) , will have the PPP loan amount deducted from the  SVOG  \namount. (If the entity received both a First Draw and Second Draw PPP Loan after December  27, 2020, \nthe combined amount will be deducted from the SVOG.)  \nFor example, if a jazz club receive d a PPP loan for $10,000 on February  1, 2021, and then applied for \nand received an SVOG which, based on the amount of its earned revenue loss would have been \n$100,000, the jazz club\u2019s  SVOG will be reduced by $10,000 and it will receive a $90,000 SVOG . Any PPP \nborrower that received a PPP loan before December  27, 2020, however, will not have the PPP loan \namount deducted from any subsequent SVOG. \n  \n9. If a portion of my PPP loan was forgiven, will that affect how much of the loan amount is \ndeducted from my SVOG? \nNo. The full amount of any PPP loan received on or after December  27, 2020, must be deducted from \nan entity\u2019s SVOG without regard to whether a portion of that PPP loan was forgiven or not. If the entity received a PPP loan prior to December  27, 2020, the PPP loan and/or its forgiveness status is \nnot factored into an SVOG.  \n \n10. Can a mobile, portable, or touring facility be a qualifying venue for an SVOG?  \nYes. Any venue, including traveling tent shows such as circuses and festivals, that meets all the \nrelated requirements in the Economic Aid Act (e.g., defined performance and audience spaces, \nlighting rig, etc.) will be considered an SVOG-qualifying venue.  \n \n11. Is a venue  with no fixed performance space eligible to apply?  \nNo. Venues must have defined performance and audience spaces. If a particular venue cannot meet \nthis requirement, it is not eligible to apply for an SVOG.  \n \n12.

However, entities  that operate seasonally will be \nsubject to alternative rules on establishing gross and earned revenue loss, qualifying for priority \nperiod funding, and documenting eligibility to accommodate for the seasonal nature of the business . \n \n14. If an entity is part of a private university, how will the SBA apply the  SVOG eligibility  barrier \nthat prohibits organizations which received more than 10% of their 2019 gross revenue from Federal  funding?  \nIf a private university owns less than a majority of an eligible entity with separate legal existence, the entity only needs to consider whether more than 10% of its own 2019 gross revenue came from Federal funding.  \n If a private university-based e ligible entity lacks separate legal existence from its parent university, or \nhas separate legal existence but is majority owned  or controlled\n by the university, it will have to look \nto the gross revenue of its parent university when determining whether it passes the barrier against \nhaving more than 10% of its 2019 gross revenue come from Federal  sources (excluding disaster \nassistance ).  \n \nNOTE: Public university -based eligible entities are not subject to the 10% cap on the Federal share of \ntheir gross revenue because they are owned by state or local governments.   See FAQ #20 in this \nsection  below.  \n \n15. If a no n-profit foundation\u2019s principal business activity is soliciting donations for a museum or \nlive venue operator or promoter, is that foundation eligible?  \nNo. Under such an arrangement the foundation\u2019s principal business activity  would be serving as  a \nfiscal agent for the university -owned museum or live venue operator or promoter rather than acting \nas a museum operator or live venue operator or promoter as is required by the Economic Aid Act.  \n \n16. For private college and university -owned entities seeking eligibility, does the 10% F ederal \nfunding barrier include financial aid that is awarded to students such as Pell grants?  \nYes. Based upon the treatment given Pell grants by the Department of Education, they would be \nincluded in the amount of Federal funding provided to college and university -owned entities that do \nnot have separate legal existence.  \n \n17. Are eligible entities owned by public universities, including municipally -owned colleges, \nconsidered government -owned eligible entities for the SVOG program? \nYes. Eligible entities owned by public universities will be subject to all the same restrictions and exceptions as other government-owned entities.  \n \n18. If a university owns and operates two eligible en tities that are not separate legal entities from \nthe university, but are managed by two different university departments with their own budget \nlines and professional staffing (though their budgets roll up into the larger university system \nbudget and staff members are university employees), may the two eligible entities each apply \nfor an SVOG if they meet all the required criteria? \nOnly if it is a public university  (see FAQ #32 in this section ). If the university is a private institution, it \nwould be subject  to the restriction against the submission of multiple applications under a single EIN. \nIn that case, both entities would have to be combined into a single application submitted under the \nuniversity\u2019s EIN.  \n ", "doc_id": "0b985342-f33a-4a48-bccf-61b50824711f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6940a5c9c997034d4f4b3ffaad6f54a02da1b1e661e9d9837061dbafb10d79b3", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o6swRJPStcdtGiakovvcFj2PGG57d6Q7/view", "title": "Copy of 10-20-21 SVOG FAQ FINAL_508_final.pdf", "page": 3}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3464}, "relationships": {"1": "718b2356-ce2d-4dcb-ab18-5669fd526a44"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ecfa21c3-6d7d-4ff0-8cfe-17193ecdeebf": {"__data__": {"text": "5 | Page19.

The Economic Aid Act provides that, for government -owned entities , the eligible entity  is the liv e\nv\nenue operator or promoter, live performing arts organization operator, museum operator, movie\ntheatre operator  or owner , or talent representative and does not include any government -owned\nentity that is not one of those types of entities .\nT\nhe only form of T ribally owned entity that is eligible for SVOG assistance is a T ribally own ed\nmuseum.  Tribally  owned museums are specifically authorized to be eligible for SVOG assistance.

Are s\nervice and support companies that provide stages, lighting, sound, casts, and oth er\ns\nupport for live performing arts events or which showcase performers or pre- packaged\nproductions  to potential buyers eligible to apply  for an SVOG?\nNo. The Economic Aid Act is designed to assist only those eligible entities identified in the statute.\nSVOG s are not available for service providers that support eligible entities.\n22. Are en\ntities whose broader business operations in clude hosting live performing arts event s,\nsuc\nh as a gricultural fairs or party boats/pleasure cruises  that feature concerts, eligible ?\nMaybe.

Its principal business activity  must be  acting  as one of\neligible entity types in the statute.\n23. Are ap\nplicants  currently involved in bankruptcy proceedings eligible ?\nPossibly. Eligible entities undergoing  a reorganization form of  bankruptcy (such as Chapter 11  or\nChapter  13) may apply for an SVOG  if they entered bankruptcy after February 29, 2020.

Does a cruise ship count as a qualifying venue for promoters or producers to stage \nperformances on or for a talent representative to book performers?  \nThe cruise ship itself would  likely  not be eligible . However, a  cruise ship may serve as a qualifying \nvenue for the business activities of eligible entities if it meets all the venue requirements established \nunder the Economic Aid Act (defined performance and audience spaces, lighting rig, mixing \nequipment, etc.). For example, a promoter that books performances on cruise ships would be eligible \nto apply for an SVOG.   \n \n27. Must a promoter, theatrical producer, live performing arts organization, or talent representative stage all its events or book all its clients at qualify ing venues?  \nNo, they must use qualifying venues for a majority of the events (more than 50 % they stage or book \nclients into . Requiring these types of eligible entities  to exclusively use qualifying venues would fail  to \nrecognize  the reality of live performing arts industry business operations and lead to the extreme \nresult of the SBA e xcluding otherwise eligible entities for  something as slight as hav ing used a single \nnon-qualifying venue . As such, the SBA has interpreted the Economic Aid Act  to require a promoter, \ntheatrical producer, live performing arts organization, or talent representative to use qualifying \nvenues for a majority  of the events  (more than 50%) they stage  or book  clients into .  \n \n28. If an entity qualifies under two different categories of eligible entities (for example, a museum \nand a live venue operator) which category should be used when applying?

What types of T ribal ly-owned entities are eligible to apply?  \nThe Economic Aid Act does not include T ribes in its definitions of states or political subdivision s of \nstates, which are both permitted to own eligible entities . However, the Act\u2019s definition of \u201crelevant \nmuseum operator \u201d references section 273 of the Museum and Library Services Act (20 U.S.C. 9172) , \nwhich  specifically includes Tribal museums. As such, Tribal ly-owned museums are the only Tribally -\nowned entities  eligible for SVOGs.  \n \n32. Because government -owned eligible entities generally operate as divisions of T ribal, state, or \nlocal governments and do not have their own EINs or separate legal existence, will the SBA look to the governmental owners of such entities for purposes of determining the principal business \nactivity?  \nNo, the SBA examine the principal business activity  of the applying  itself and not solely  consider the \noperations of its owner, even where the entity uses the EIN of its  government -owner  or parent \ncompany .  \n ", "doc_id": "709a6f05-1f38-4a67-976e-7cd2e9286e8b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "69212ed01513a95cfb58aafbab08c9149e45d934518badf713bb64d241042e67", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o6swRJPStcdtGiakovvcFj2PGG57d6Q7/view", "title": "Copy of 10-20-21 SVOG FAQ FINAL_508_final.pdf", "page": 5}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3639}, "relationships": {"1": "dad7eadf-6b14-47a1-b33f-734b115c35ef"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a3f8ab4-52d3-4bab-b120-bdcef3ae5a96": {"__data__": {"text": "7 | Page  33.

Can  an entity with no staff or payroll qualify for the program?  \nYes. For example, an entity such as a promoter or talent representative that operates as a sole \nproprietorship or single member LLC with no employees could be eligible for an SVOG. In such a case, it would use its SVOG funding for non-payroll costs such as the payment of rent, utilities, scheduled \ndebts, maintenance fees, taxes, etc.  \n \n35.

How did the SBA determine tha t to be eligible for SVOG assistance an entity could not do \nbusiness in certain identified countries ? \nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which includes the Economic Aid Act , states that SVOG \nfunds may not be obligated or expended to directly finance  any assistance or reparations for the \ngovernments of Cuba, North Korea, Iran, or Syria.  In addition, the United States has imposed \nsanctions on these four nations th rough  the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets \nControl which  cover  things such as financial and trade transactions with  entities, institutions, and \nindividuals within their borders.  \n \nMuseum or Movie Theat re Operator \n37.

Is a museum or movie theatr e with a multipurpose room with movable seating eligible? \nNo, if the only auditorium or room  in the museum or movie theatre has temporary, removable, \nmodular, convertible, or other non-fixed seating arrangements , it would not be eligible . The \nEconomic Aid Act specifically requires museums and motion picture theatre s have \nfixed audience \nseating .

What happens if a motion picture theatre is owned by one entity, but operated (managed) by a\nseparate entity? Are both entities eligible for an SVO G in such a case?  If so, what will the earned\nrevenues of the two companies be based upon?Yes. Under the Economic Aid Act, owners and  operators of motion picture theatres are considered\neligible entities.\nIn cases where both the owner and the operator of a qualifying motion picture theatre separately\napply for  SVO G, each will base its earned revenues upon its share of those payments received as a\ncondition of its ownership or operation of the motion picture theatre.

The Economic Aid Act\u2019s live venue operator or promoter definition requires an entity to have as\nits principal business activity  either:\n(1) Organizing, promoting, producing, managing, or hosting events by performing artists for\nwhich admission fees are charged and performers are paid based on a percentage of sales,  a\ngu\narantee, or other mutually beneficial formal arrangement; or\n(2) Publicly selling tickets on average 60 days in advance of performing arts events for whichperformers are paid based on a percentage of sales, a guarantee,  or other mutually beneficial\nformal arrangement.\nWhile ticket brokers or resellers do deal in tickets to performing arts events and may do so 60 days in \nadvance, performers are not paid from these transactions.

At which priority or phase is number of employees considered?\nThere is no priority based on number of employees in the application process.

Will the SBA require entities to use the accrual method of accounting only when \ndetermining their qualification for a priority period, or must they also rely on the accrual \nmethod for establishing their award amount and/or non -priority period eligibility ? \nThe accrual method of accounting is only required when determining whether an entity qualifies for one of the priority periods under the Economic Aid Act. For all other purposes, an entity may rely \nupon either the accrual or cash method of accounting ; SBA recommends applicants use the same \naccounting method used for their Federal Tax Return.  \n \n142. Can  government -owned eligible entities receive funds  during the first or second priority \nperiods?  \nNo. The first and second priority periods are designed to assist the eligible entities that have faced \nthe most significant losses while having limited means to make up for lost revenue. Tribal, state,  and \nlocal governments have access to taxpayer funds and other resources which private individuals or \norganizations lack.  \n143. How will the SBA prioritize applications within each priority period? Will it be on a first-\ncome, first -served basis or will it be based on the size of the percentage of revenue loss \nsuffered?  \nWithin each priority period and the non-priority p eriod, the SBA will process applications in the order \nin which they were received.  \n \n144. Where will a non -profit entity fit into the application periods?  \nNon -profits are eligible for the same priority periods as all other eligible entities.

Once the qualifying employees are \ndetermined , an entity must then calculate the average number of employees it had  over the prior \nyear by adding up the number of qualifying employees in each individual pay period and dividing that \namount by the number of pay periods over the 12 -month period from March  1, 2019 to February  29, \n2020.  \nFor example, assume a firm paid its employees monthly  and had the following number of qualifying \nemployees each pay period:  \n\u2022 Mar  2019 \u2013 9.5 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Apr 2019 \u2013 8 full -time employees  \n\u2022 May 2019 \u2013 9.5 full-time employees  \n\u2022 Jun  2019 \u2013 8.5 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Jul 2019 \u2013 10 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Aug  2019 \u2013 10 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Sep  2019 \u2013 7 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Oct 2019 \u2013 8.5 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Nov  2019 \u2013 7 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Dec  2019 \u2013 6 full -time employees   \n\u2022 Jan 2020 \u2013 7.5 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Feb  2020 \u2013 6 full -time employees  \n \nThe sum of the firm\u2019s full- time employees is 97.5. The firm would then divide 97.5 by 12 (the number \nof pay periods) to determine  its average number of full -time employees  was eight . \n \n175. Are institutions of more than 500 employees eligible to apply  for an SVOG if they meet  other \neligibility criteria?  \nYes, as long as the entity does not also operate in more than 10 states AND in more than one country . \n \n176. For determining employee counts and the average number of employees, what should an \nentity do if the date range doesn\u2019t match neatly with the payroll schedule  (e.g., biweekly)?  \nAn entity\u2019s average number of full -time employees will be determined with reference to each pay \nperiod that falls, either in whole or in part, within the 12-month timeframe stipulated by the Economic Aid Act.  \n For example, if an entity\u2019s biweekly pay period ran from February  18, 2019, to Mar ch 3, 2019, that pay \nperiod would be considered when determining the entity\u2019s number of full -time employees, even \nthough only three days of that pay period fell within the 12-month timeframe. In this case, the entity would average the employee\u2019s weekly hours for that pay period ( including the days that fell outside ", "doc_id": "18d9e6fe-241e-4f5b-aa1a-49230042ad30", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "57d81e84dedcc0041cf5397b3dbd0e063110c6fce024838e63c25ca8a0c958d7", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o6swRJPStcdtGiakovvcFj2PGG57d6Q7/view", "title": "Copy of 10-20-21 SVOG FAQ FINAL_508_final.pdf", "page": 27}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2796}, "relationships": {"1": "22b4358a-30b1-4dcf-901a-ade5a6340cb1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5868f09-f2a5-45a5-b123-2ef7e33152b0": {"__data__": {"text": "29 | Page  the 12-month timeframe) to determine if they were a full -time employee in the first covered pay \nperio d.

If an entity has a biweekly payroll schedule it will likely have some staff who work less than \n10 hours for the first week of a pay period and more than 10 hours for the second week of a pay period. Would the entity average their total hours over those two weeks to determi ne if they \nwere a full -time employee for purposes of that pay period? \nYes, when calculating their number of full -time employees, entities will use a weekly average of the \nemployees\u2019 total hours over that pay period.  \n For example, if an entity has a biweek ly pay period and an employee worked 10 hours the first week \nand 30 hours the second week, the employee would have worked an average of 20 hours per week during that pay period  and  would be considered half a full-time employee for that pay period.

What is the full- time employee calculation used for?  \nThe SBA will look to the number of full-time employees retained by an entity for three purposes:  \n(1) To determin e whether the entity  has more than 500 employees and thus may be \nineligible for the SVOG if it also meets other criteria;  \n(2) To determin e whether  the entity has between 500 and 10,000 employees and is thus \nsubject to the certification regarding labor rights; and  \n(3) To see if the entity is eligible  for the small employer set -aside.   \n \n179. Do independent contractors count as employees for purposes of the small employer set -\naside? The SBA will consider the totality of the circumstances, including criteria used by the IRS for Federal \nincome tax purposes, in determining whether individuals are employees of a concern. Where the IRS \nconsiders an individual to be an independent contractor rather than an employee, the SBA will do the \nsame. \n \n180. If an eligible entity is run by a management company does  the owner report that it doesn\u2019t \nhave any employees , or is it required to include the number of individuals working for the \nmanagement company  in its application ? \nAn eligible entity must only list its own full-time employees on its application, if any . The owner \nwould not include employees of the management company.  \n \n181. Can a T ribal,  state, or local government -owned eligible entity qualify for the small employer \nset- aside?  \nYes.

What does it mean for two or more entities to be affi liated?  \nAffiliation occurs where one firm has the power to control another firm, or a single person or entity \nhas the power to control both. Affiliation typically arises due to common ownership, management, or \nthrough contractual or other legal arrangement s. The SBA uses the principle of affiliation to help it \ndetermine if an entity is eligible for some government program or benefit reserved for small businesses. Where firms are found to be affiliated with one another, the SBA will combine their \nrevenues and number of employees and compare those aggregated amounts to the relevant size \nlimit for the program or benefit one of the firms is seeking. In this way, the SBA ensures that a firm \nwhich appears to be small but is actually controlled by a large corporation does not take a benefit meant only for small firms. The rules regarding affiliation in the context of SBA\u2019s financial assistance \nprograms may be found at 13 C.F.R. \u00a7121.301(f).  \n \n209. How will the SBA apply the principle of affiliation to the SVOG program? \nIn administering the SVOG program, the SBA will consider the principle of affiliation in the following \ntwo contexts:  \n(1) In applying the two provisions of the Economic Aid Act that specifically reference affiliation.   \nFirst, it says affiliated firms (including subsidiaries) may apply for SVOGs on their own if they meet all the eligibility requirements. Second, it says that no more than five affiliated firms may receive SVOGs. In applying these two provisions, the SBA will rely upon the general \nprinciples of 1 3 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.301(f) to determine when firms are affiliated.  \n(2) In determining whether an entity  qualifies for the small employer set -aside  or is subject to the \ncertification regarding protecting labor rights.

Can two affiliated eligible entities both use the e mployer identification number of their \nparent to apply for their own SVOG? For example, could a concert hall and a movie theatre owned by the same parent entity each use that parent entity\u2019s EIN to apply?  \nYes.  \n \n219. When will the SBA consider two entities with common ownership to be affiliated for \npurposes of the SVOG program? \nConsistent with the affiliation regulations for financial assistance programs  (see 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n121.301(f)) the SBA will consider two firms to be affiliated based on ownership  for purposes of the \nSVOG program where one firm owns more than 50% of the other o r a single person or entity owns \nmore than 50% of both.  \n \n220. Can 2 or more firms affiliated due to their common ownership by another firm apply jointly?  \nWhile affiliates may apply  for the SVOG program  in their own name or may be included in an \napplication subm itted by their ultimate parent entity, they cannot team up together on an \napplication unless one of the firms owns more than 50% of the other.  \n For example, if Company A owns 100% of Company B, which owns 100% of Company C, then \nCompany C could apply in its own name or be included in either A or B\u2019s application. Conversely, if \nCompanies B and C are both 100% owned by Company A then they could each apply in their own \nname or be included in A\u2019s application , but B and C could not pair up together to submit an SVOG \napplication.  \n \n221. If an entity does not have DUNS numbers for affiliates that will be listed  as part of its SVOG \napplication , but the affiliates do not qualify for a SVOG (and won\u2019t be applying), does it need to \nhave DUN S numbers for those affi liates?  \nNo. If an entity does not currently have DUNS numbers for non -SVOG eligible affiliates it is not \nrequired to obtain such registration s to submit  an SVOG application.  \n \n222. Does the limit on having no more than five pending applications or receiving no more than \nfive  SVOG awards per group of affiliated entities apply to government -owned entities? \nNo, the SBA will not limit T ribal, state,  or local governments to having no more than five  pending \nSVOG applications or to receiving no more than five  SVOGs.

Can affiliated entities use the same SAM registration to apply for up to five SVOGs or should \neach affiliated entity that desires to receive a SVOG individually obtain its own SAM \nregistration? With the exception of T ribal, state,  or local government -owned eligible entities , which as previously \nnoted typically do not have their own EINs and thus will also lack their own SAM registration, each \nentity applying for an SVOG must use its own SAM registration.  \n 224. If an entity is disregarded for tax purposes and doesn\u2019t file its own tax returns, should the \ndisregarded entity apply for an SVOG or should the entity that files tax returns apply for the SVOG? \nAssuming both entities have their own separate legal existence,  and each meets the eligibility \nrequirements under the Economic Aid Act, either could apply for an SVOG.  \n225.

The agency would like to provide additional process for these applicants who are eligible \nunder statute to attempt to prove their eligibility.

(81 FR 41423) This modification streamlines, \nseparates , and distinguishes  the rules for small busine ss applicants in  the Business Loan, \nDisaster Loan and Surety Bond Guarantee Programs (\u201cSBG\u201d)\n from the rules for government \ncontracting, business development and ot her programs . The revised regulations governing \naffiliation for the Business Loan, Disaster L oan and SBG Programs are located at 1 3 CFR \n\u00a7121.301(f)  and will be effective July 27, 2016.  \n \nFor purposes of this rule, the Business Loan Programs consist of the 7(a) Loan Program, the \nMicroloan Program, the Intermediary Lending Pilot Program (\u201cILP\u201d), and the Development \nCompany Loan Program (\u201c504 Loan Program\u201d). The Disaster Loan Programs consist of Physical \nDisaster Business Loans, Economic Injury Disaster Loans, Military Reservist Economic Injury \nDisaster Loans, and Immediate Disaster Assistance Program  loans.  \n \nThe following summarizes the contents of the new regulations set forth at 13 CFR \u00a7121.301(f):  \n \n\u2022 Affiliation Based on Ownership, \u00a7121.301(f) (1). SBA will deem that control exists based \non ownership when a person owns or has the power to control more  than 50% of the \nvoting equity of a concern. I f no one person owns or has the power to control more than \n50% of the voting equity of the concern, SBA will deem the Board of Directors or President  or Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the concern (or other of ficers, managing \nmembers, partners, or directors who control the management of the concern) to be in control of the concern. \n \n \nSBA will deem a minority shareholder to be in control if that individual or entity has the ability, under the concern\u2019s charter, by -laws, or shareholder\u2019s agreement, to prevent a \nquorum or otherwise block action by the board of directors or shareholders . \n Formerly, SBA required the aggregation of the ownership interests of multiple minority shareholders , or two or more owners whose holdings are equal but less than 50% to \ndetermine control when no person owns 50% or more of the voting stock.  Instead, the new rule simply determines control to the Board and/or company officers when there is not a majority shareholder with voting rights .  \n  SBA Information Notice \n \n \n \n", "doc_id": "aaa07890-7487-4f4d-8aab-ba18aebd1f86", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a24ee2342f6d5aae7498d9ece348842cd4a0dca1dccd5656dcb17b7ef7f21561", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fY9ImHROg_91MoBqFdLwZLb6M6qw4wQZ/view", "title": "Copy of 5000-1388_Affiliation_1.pdf", "page": 0}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2782}, "relationships": {"1": "6d9a146a-2010-4d80-8e63-fe24d0374bc3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "766e99b7-45ac-40df-9403-9adf82f191d0": {"__data__": {"text": "PAGE 2 of 3 EXPIRES:  7/1/17  \nSBA Form 1353.3 (4- 93) MS Word Edition; previous editions obsolete  \nMust be accompanied by SBA Form 58 \nFeder al Recy cling Program   Printed on Recycled Paper \u2022 Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible securities, and agreements to merge , \n\u00a7121.301(f)(2).

SBA will utilize the same general \nprinciples of affiliation based on common management set forth in \u00a7121.103(e) . In \naddition, SBA has modified the language to clarify that affiliation may also arise where a \nsingle individual, concern or entity  controls the management of the applicant concern \nthrough a management agreement. Details on the types of management agreements that \nresult in determinations  of affiliation will be provided in SBA  Loan Program \nRequirements.    \n \n\u2022 Affiliation based on identity of interest, \u00a7121.301(f)(4).  SBA will deem that af filiation \narises when there is an identity of interest between close relatives (as defined in 13 CFR \n120.10) , with identical or substantially identical business or economic interests (such as \nwhere the close relatives operate concerns in the same or similar industry in the same geographic area) . SBA is removing other business and third party relationships  from the \nregulation on identity of interest .  \n The former finding of identity of interest that included unrelated individuals with common investments, and firms economically dependent on one another as being affiliated was removed.  \n \n\u2022 Affiliation based on franchise and license agreements , \u00a7121.301(f)(5). SBA has limited \nthe franchise or license agreem ent reviews to the applicant franchisee or licensee and the \nfranchisor. No review will be  conducted for size based on affiliation for any franchise or \nlicense relationship of an affiliate of the applicant.  (Note: this does not remove the \nrequirement to det ermine size based on sales, receipts or employees for the applicant and \nall affiliates.)   \n SBA does not consider that franchise or license relationships create affiliation, provided, that the franchisee applicant  has the right to profit from its efforts an d bears the risk of \nloss commensurate with ownership. Details on the determination of the franchisee/licensee\u2019s right to profit from its efforts and bear the risk of loss commensurate with ownership will be provided in SBA Loan Program Requirements. \n Forme rly SBA required review of all franchise agreements of all franchises owned by the \nfranchisee, not just the applicant agreement.  \n \n\u2022 Determining the concern\u2019s size , \u00a7121.301(f)(6) .  In determining the concern's size, SBA \ncounts the receipts, employees (\u00a7121.201), or net income and net worth ( the alternate size \nstandard ), if applicable , of the concern whose size is at issue and all of its domestic and \nforeign affiliates, regardless of whether the affiliates are organized for profit.  \n ", "doc_id": "766e99b7-45ac-40df-9403-9adf82f191d0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "57de9cf3f4ae6e6fd8e19407f379de346c17432af6cc7011f638cea38d278956", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fY9ImHROg_91MoBqFdLwZLb6M6qw4wQZ/view", "title": "Copy of 5000-1388_Affiliation_1.pdf", "page": 1}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3051}, "relationships": {"1": "26750828-8949-4b67-9f72-b8e73631743f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0037898-0c46-4e00-907f-27f16b62f8be": {"__data__": {"text": "EXPIRES:   7/1/17  PAGE 3 of 3 \nSBA Form 1353.3 (4- 93) MS Word Edition; previous editions obsolete  \nMust be accompanied by SBA Form 58 \nFederal Recyling Program   Printed on Recycled Paper \u2022 Exceptions to affiliation , \u00a7121.301(f)(7 ).

While SBA is best  known for its financial support of small businesses  through its many \nlending programs , the Agency also plays a critical role in providing funding to organizations that deliver  \ntechnical assistance in the form of  counseling and  training  to small business con cerns and nascent \nentrepreneurs  in order to promot e growth, expansion, innovation, increased productivity and \nmanagement improvement.   \nThe mission of SBA\u2019s Office of Innovation & Technology,  which bears  responsib ility for administering \nthe FAST  Program,  is to strengthen the technological competitiv eness of small businesses across the \ncountry through coordination of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business \nTechnology Transfer (STTR) programs .  The FAST program focuses on i ncreasing the participation of \nsmall firms in the innovation and commerc ialization of high risk technologies, keeping  the United \nStates on the cutting edge of next generation research and devel opment .  \n1.4 Purpose  \nThe Federal and State Technology ( FAST ) Partnership  Program provides  one year funding to \norganizations to execute state/regional programs that increase the number of SBIR/STTR proposals \n(through outreach and financial support); increase the number of SBIR/STTR awards (through technical \nassistance and mentoring); and better prepare SBIR/STTR  awardees for commercialization success \n(through technical assistance and mentoring).  \nAs set forth in the Small Business Act (Rev.13)  FAST awar ds build  the SBIR/ST TR ecosystem through : \n1.

Financial support : mak e grants or loans to  applicants  to pay a portion or all of the cost of \ndeveloping SBIR/STTR proposals, attending relevant conferences, and bridging possible gaps \nbetween phases.  \n3. Technical assistance : encourage the transition from Phase I to II and commercialization of \ntechnology develop ed through SBIR /STTR program funding ; and form and or support  mentoring \nnetwork s to provide  business advice and  counseling.  \n  \n1.5 Leveraging of Resources  \nApplicants selected for awards under this Announcement are required to maximize their efforts to \nleverage SBA funding by working in conjunction with other public and private entities that provide \nsupport or have resources that would benefit SBIR/STTR applicants and/or awardees :  \na.

See, 15 USC 634(b)(14); 13 CFR 120.1070; \nand SOP s 50 53 2, Ch. 5 and 50 10 6, Part 1, Section  A, C h. 1. In accordance with this authority, \nSBA charges 7(a) Lenders fees for monitoring, including the quarterly off -site/monitoring reviews \nconducted through the Loan and Lender Monitoring System (L/LMS) . SBA also charges 7(a) \nLenders fees to co ver the costs of the following reviews: ( 1) Desktop/ Analytical Reviews; ( 2) \nTargeted Reviews; ( 3) Limited Scope Reviews ; (4) Full Scope Reviews; ( 5) Delegated Authority \nReviews; and ( 6) Other Reviews (e.g., Agreed Upon Procedures Reviews, Secondary Market \nReviews) . In addition, SBA\u2019s oversight fees include costs related to Other Lender Oversight \nActivities (e.g., technical assistance and analytics, a portion of OCRM salaries for 7(a) Lender \noversight activities, supervision and enforcement activit ies, and similar costs to support SBA\u2019s \nlender oversight program) .  \nThese oversight fees are based on SBA\u2019s costs . The fees for monitoring (e.g., L/LMS and \nsubscription services), Other Lender Oversight Activities, and Delegated Authority Reviews are \nassessed annually based on each 7(a) Lender\u2019s portion of the total dollar amount of 7(a) guarantees \nin SBA\u2019s portfolio or, as applicable, the relevant portfolio segment the activity covers . For \npurposes of this calculation, a Lender\u2019s portfolio  size is determined as of the end of the prior fiscal \nyear. (Where the costs that SBA incurs for the oversight activity are specific to a particular 7(a) \nLender, such as for the Desktop/ Analytical Reviews, Targeted Reviews, Limited or Full Scope \nReviews, a nd Other Reviews, the Lender is assessed a fee based on SBA\u2019s costs and is billed \nfollowing the completion of the review.)

The charge for the Federally \nRegulated 7(a) Lenders is slightly higher because it includes the costs associ ated with oversight \ntools that are not applicable to SBA Supervised Lenders . For FY 202 3, the additional fee for \nDelegated Authority Lenders is approximately $ 12.79  for every $1 million in 7(a) guaranteed \ndollars a delegated Lender has outstanding . This fee covers the costs of Delegated Authority \nReviews and is assessed annually based on each delegated 7(a) Lender\u2019s portion of the total dollar \namount of 7(a) guarantees in the SBA loan portfolio for all delegated 7(a) Lenders as of the end \nof the prio r fiscal year .

Estimated total program funding is five-million dollars ($5,000,000). Award amounts may vary, \ndepending upon availability of funds (and performance for option years); however, no single grantee may receive more than $250,000 or ten (10) percent of the total f unds made available for \nthis program in a single fiscal year, whichever is less. In general, ma tch is required, although SBA \nmay reduce or eliminate match in certain circum stances (up to a program limit of 10 percent).  \nThe period of performance for this grant is one base year with four (4) twelve-month options \nsubject to availability of funds. The total possible period of performance is five (5) years. Each \noption year will constitute a separate budget period. The project recipient\u2019s satisfactory \nperformance will be one of the key factors in dete rmining the award of an option year. Failure to \nsecure the required annual non- Federal contribution during any project year may jeopardize \ncontinued option year funding.  \nApplications will be first screened  to determine if the applicant m eets certain mandatory eligibility \nrequirements. Applicants that do not document in their application that they meet these \nrequirements will not be evaluated by SBA for participation in the PRIME program. Eligible proposals will be scored by an Objective Review  Committee (ORC) based on specific evaluation \ncriteria.  \nEXPIRES:   PAGE 1 of 1 \nSBA Form 1353.3 (4-93) MS Word Edit ion; previous editions obsolete \nMust be accompanied by SBA Form 58 \nFederal Recyling Program   Printed on Recycled Paper ", "doc_id": "d43fb5a8-3e01-4dde-8d63-76c185307a4b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "812d8fc56ffa1deefa0c59984389625e91b8646571c5c45dbb3926e62f0ae488", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JaIPDKPhZw24CHc9vnnHIYydxv9QwcaR/view", "title": "Copy of bank_5000-1117_0.pdf", "page": 0}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2895}, "relationships": {"1": "b6ef55de-3944-414a-b16e-a4f3972313e9"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "78b8ac86-bc22-4ccf-9e0c-ffc48f80a578": {"__data__": {"text": "PAGE 2 of 2 EXPIRES:   \nSBA Form 1353.3 (4-93) MS Word Edit ion; previous editions obsolete \nMust be accompanied by SBA Form 58 \nFederal Recyling Program   Printed on Recycled Paper  \nUpdated 9/22/2009 The Objective Review Committee will consist of SB A officials and may include Federal Officials \nfrom other agencies.

L. No. 111-5).  The Recovery Act is \nexpected to save or create millions of jobs, in  part through increased lending to businesses.  As \npart of the Recovery Act, SBA\u2019s Microloan Program received additional funding to support up to $50 million in new lending volume and $24 milli on in new technical assistance grants. \n \nThis notice is to inform microloan intermed iaries (\u201cIntermediari es\u201d) that, effective \nimmediately and until further notice,  all new loans and grant awards made to \nIntermediaries will be funded with Recovery Act dollars .  One of the goals of the \nAdministration is to ensure grea ter transparency as to the use of Recovery Act dollars.  As a \nresult, recipients of Recovery Act funds are subject to a new set of reporting requirements  \n(Section 1512 of the Recovery Act), which are subject to gui dance issued by the Office of \nManagement and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d).   \n \nThis notice also provides information on ho w the Recovery Act reporting requirements \napply to Intermediaries .  This may impact the information that Intermediaries require from \ntheir microloan borrowers.  The new reporting re quirements are subject to change by OMB, but \nSBA is committed to assisting Intermediaries with the requirements. In addition, SBA is \nmodifying microloan agreements to contain new terms and conditions that will require \nIntermediaries  to submit reports for any Recovery Act funded loans and grants and that will \naddress other requirements set forth in th e Recovery Act and OMB\u2019s guidance.  See \nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/recovery_default/\n. \n Reporting Requirements for Intermediaries \n \nSection 1512 of the Recovery Ac t establishes new reporting requirements for the funds provided \nin the Act.  For Intermediaries, two of th e most important changes to existing reporting \nrequirements are: \n \nA. Required registration with three databa ses to receive identifying numbers for \nIntermediaries. (DUNS, CCR and Federal Reporting.gov)  \nB. Quarterly submission of re porting data directly to FederalReporting.gov\n. \n \nThe new quarterly reporting requirement is in addition to  the current Microloan Program \nreporting requirements.

Compliance with the \nreporting requirements will be considered a part of the Intermediary\u2019s performance record.  \nNote \nthat noncompliance with the reporting require ments is a violation of the loan agreement \nand/or grant award.  \n \nA. Database Registration  \n \nThere are three places where Intermediaries mu st register if they have not previously \nregistered with these databases.  SBA recommends completing these registrations in the following order.  \n1. Dun & Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number \n(www.dnb.com ) \nHow to register: DUNS numbers may be requested via the Web ( www.dnb.com ).  \nDUNS number assignment is free for all or ganizations required to register with \nthe Federal government for contracts or gr ants.  More instructions on requesting a \nDUNS number are available on grants.gov. (http://www.grants.gov/applic ants/request_duns_number.jsp\n) \n \n2. Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov ) \nHow to register:  Registration may be completed via the Web (www.ccr.gov ) and, \ndepending upon the size and complexity of your organization, it may take several days to complete and process your registration request. Because CCR is a \nfederally mandated program, there is no cost  for registrants.  Intermediaries using \nRecovery Act funds must maintain current  registrations in the CCR at all times \nduring which they are required to report through FederalReporting.gov.  Note that \na DUNS Number is required for registration in the CCR.  \n3.  FederalReporting.Gov (www.FederalReporting.gov)  \nHow to register: This website is OMB\u2019s online we b portal that will collect all \nRecovery Act recipient reports.   Reporting recipients mu st be registered as \nauthorized parties prior to submitting recipient reports on FederalReporting.gov .  \nIn order to register with FederalRepor ting.gov, Intermediaries  must already be \nregistered in CCR and must have a DUNS  number.

If notified of quality  issues, the report will be unlocked and the \nIntermediary will have until the 29\nth day following the end of the quarter to complete any \nSBA-requested data corrections.

The \ndeclared disaster areas may be found at http:// www.sba.gov/disaster .   \n \nTo further support these recovery efforts, the Agency w ill provide  relief to certain borrowers , \nincluding SBA Microlenders,  with existing 7(a), 504, 7(m)  and disaster loans.   Effective \nimmediately, the Agency is providing an automatic 12 month  deferment of principal and interest \npayments for SBA -serviced  business and disaster loans  that were in \u201cregular servicing\u201d status on \nAugust 25, 2017 , in those primary counties designated as Federal disaster areas.  Interest will \ncontinue to accrue on the loans involved.  Borrowers will be notified of the automatic d eferment \non their monthly payment notices (SBA Forms 1201).  Borrowers preferring to continue making \nregular payments during the deferment period should notify their respective SBA servicing \ncenter to make alternative payment arrangements.  After this automatic 12 month  deferment \nperiod, SBA will review borrower circumstances on a case -by-case basis to determine the nature \nand extent of further relief appropriate for each situation.    \n \nBorrowers that are located in counties /parishes  contiguous to the  primar y county in the  disaster \nareas and have suffered an adverse impact because of the disaster  may be eligible for 9 month s \nof deferment of principal and interest payments on SBA -serviced business and disaster loans.  \nSBA will not automatically provide deferme nts on these loans, but an adversely impacted \nborrower in one of the identified contiguous counties /parishes  may request a deferment through \nthe SBA office servicing the loan.  SBA will evaluate these requests on a case -by-case basis, and \nmay provide defer ments when the borrower can show it needs such relief as a result of the \ndisaster.   SBA loan servicing personnel in these areas sh all advise borrowers experiencing \ndifficulty in making their loan payments that they may request deferment of these payments.   \n \nSBA is also strongly encouraging 7(a) Lenders , Certified Development Companies ( CDCs)  (as \nwell as third party lenders that provide the private sector financing for 504 projects ), and \nMicrolenders  to provide similar deferment relief for borrowers with lender  or CDC -serviced  \nSBA -business  loans in the primary disaster areas and contiguous counties /parishes .  District \noffices and servicing centers  shall advise  lenders of the need to accommodate borrowers \nadversely affected by  the events of Hurricane Harvey .  Since many SBA -guaranteed loans are \nsold in the secondary market, it is also important to note that 7(a) Lenders can provide one 90 \nday deferment without requesting approval from the secondary market purchaser.

SBA must \nobtain your taxpayer identification number when you apply for a loan. If you receive a loan, and do not make payments as they come due, SBA may take one or more of the following actions: (1) report the status of your  loan(s) or other debt owed to SBA to credit bureaus, (2) hire a collection agency to collect your loan or other delinquent debt, (3) offset your income tax refund or other amounts due to you from the Federal Government, (4) suspend or debar you or your company from doing business with the Federal Government, (5) refer your loan to the Department of Justice or other attorneys for litigation, or (6) foreclose on collateral or take other action permitted in the loan instruments. Finally, if you default on an SBA loan and fail to fully reimburse the Agency for any resulting loss, SBA may  refer you to the computer database of delinquent Federal debtors maintained by the Department of Housing and Urban Development or another Federal agency. This referral may result in your being disqualified from receiving financial assistance from other Federal agencies. In addition, unless SBA is reimbursed in full for the loss, you will not eligible for additional SBA financial assistance. \nFlood Disaster Protection Act (42 U.S.C. 4011) -- Regulations have been issued by the Federal Insurance \nAdministration (FIA) and by SBA implementing this Act and its amendments. These regulations prohibit SBA from making certain loans in an FIA designated floodplain unless Federal Flood insurance is purchased as a condition of the loan. Failure to maintain the required level of flood insurance makes the applicant ineligible for any financial assistance from SBA, including disaster assistance. \nExecutive Orders -- Floodplain Management and Wetland Protection (42 F.R. 26951 and 42 F.R. 26961) -- SBA \ndiscourages settlement in or development of a floodplain or a wetland. This statement is to notify all SBA loan applicants that such actions are hazardous to both life and property and should be avoided.

Businesses that do not comply may be fined and required to abate the hazards in their workplaces.  They may also be ordered to cease operations posing an imminent danger of death or serious injury until employees can be protected.

These changes will further \nimprove the review process for franchise, license, de aler, jobber or similar agreements ( collectively \nreferred to as \u201c franchise agreements\u201d) as currently set forth  in SBA\u2019s Standard Operating Procedure \n(SOP) 50 10 5( I). As further described below, the changes  will temporarily permit a 7(a) lender or \nCertifie d Development Company (CDC) to submit  a certification  from the franchisor  together with an \naddendum  previous ly negotiated with SBA in lieu of the SBA Addendum to Franchise A greement  \n(SBA Form 2462)  that is required under the current version of the SOP .  In addition, SBA has revised \nthe SBA Addendum to Franchise Agreement (SBA Form 2462) to, among other things, incorporate \nagreements other than \u201cfranchise agreements\u201d (e.g., license, dealer, jobber agreements).   \n \nEffective immediately and u ntil further notic e, SBA will accept either of the following as  \nsufficient to establish that a franchisee is not \u201caffiliated \u201d with a franchisor: (1) the revised SBA \nAddendum to Franchise Agreement; or (2) a C ertification ( in the form attached to this Notice) \ntogether with the franchisor\u2019s SBA negotiated addendum.  SBA also is making some additional \nchanges to the franchise review process to clarify the requirements for 7(a) lenders and CDCs.  \n \nBackground  \n \nIn order to be eligible for financial assistance under SBA\u2019s loan programs, a business must be \u201csmall .\u201d \nThe Small Business Act defines a small business as \u201cone which is independently owned and operated \nand which is not dominant in its field of operation.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 632. When a business is not independently owned and operate d, but is instead affiliated with another  business , SBA aggregate s the \nemployees, receipts or other measure of size of the business and all of its affiliates to determine whether the business  is small.  \n For businesses operating under a franchise agreement , SBA  regulations  state that SBA will find \naffiliation between a franchisor and franchisee if  the franchisee does not retain the right to profit from \nits efforts or bear the risk of loss commensurate with ownership.  13 CFR \u00a7 121.301(f)(5).

SBA is now temporarily revis ing the current \npolicy to allow for the use of a n alternative to the SBA Addendum:  a  Certification by the franchisor \ntogether with the franchisor\u2019s SBA  Negotiated Addendum . The SBA Negotiated Addendum must be \nan addendum that was developed by SBA and the franchisor in connection with either a 2015 or 2016 version of a franchise agreement. If the franchisor does not have an SBA Negotiated Addendum with a 2015 or 2016 date, thi s certification alternative cannot be used and the lender must obtain the SBA \nAddendum.     The Certification (SBA Form 2463) will be executed by the franchisor and used with  an SBA  \nNegotiated Addendum to resolve any affiliation issues that arise in a particular franchise agreement.\n1  \nSpecifically, the franchisor will certify that SBA has previously reviewed its 2015 or 2016 franchise agreement, including the SBA Negotiated Addendum , and determined that the Franchise Agreement \nwith the SBA Negotiated Addendum did not create an affiliate relationship between the franchisee and \nfranchisor. The f ranchisor will also  certif y that the terms of the loan applicant\u2019s f ranchise agreement  \nhave not changed from those of the 2015 or 2016 f ranchise agreement, as such term s relate to \naffiliation (as defined in 13 CFR part 121 and SOP 50 10) between the franchisor and the franchisee, and that the  loan applicant\u2019s f ranchise agreement includes the SBA Negotiated Addendum.

SBA also charges 7(a) \nLenders fees to co ver the costs of the following reviews: ( 1) Desktop/ Analytical Reviews; ( 2) \nTargeted Reviews; ( 3) Limited Scope Reviews ; (4) Full Scope Reviews; ( 5) Delegated Authority \nReviews; and ( 6) Other Reviews (e.g., Agreed Upon Procedures Reviews, Secondary Market \nReviews) .

The fees for monitoring (e.g., L/LMS and \nsubscription services), Other Lender Oversight Activities, and Delegated Authority Reviews are \nassessed annually based on each 7(a) Lender\u2019s portion of the total dollar amount of 7(a) guarantees \nin SBA\u2019s portfolio or, as applicable, the relevant portfolio segment the activity covers . For \npurposes of this calculation, a Lender\u2019s portfolio  size is determined as of the end of the prior fiscal \nyear. (Where the costs that SBA incurs for the oversight activity are specific to a particular 7(a) \nLender, such as for the Desktop/ Analytical Reviews, Targeted Reviews, Limited or Full Scope \nReviews, a nd Other Reviews, the Lender is assessed a fee based on SBA\u2019s costs and is billed \nfollowing the completion of the review.)

As a \nresult, recipients of Recovery Act funds are subject to a new set of reporting requirements  \n(Section 1512 of the Recovery Act), which are subject to gui dance issued by the Office of \nManagement and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d).   \n \nThis notice also provides information on ho w the Recovery Act reporting requirements \napply to Intermediaries .  This may impact the information that Intermediaries require from \ntheir microloan borrowers.  The new reporting re quirements are subject to change by OMB, but \nSBA is committed to assisting Intermediaries with the requirements. In addition, SBA is \nmodifying microloan agreements to contain new terms and conditions that will require \nIntermediaries  to submit reports for any Recovery Act funded loans and grants and that will \naddress other requirements set forth in th e Recovery Act and OMB\u2019s guidance.  See \nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/recovery_default/\n. \n Reporting Requirements for Intermediaries \n \nSection 1512 of the Recovery Ac t establishes new reporting requirements for the funds provided \nin the Act.  For Intermediaries, two of th e most important changes to existing reporting \nrequirements are: \n \nA. Required registration with three databa ses to receive identifying numbers for \nIntermediaries. (DUNS, CCR and Federal Reporting.gov)  \nB. Quarterly submission of re porting data directly to FederalReporting.gov\n. \n \nThe new quarterly reporting requirement is in addition to  the current Microloan Program \nreporting requirements.

Compliance with the \nreporting requirements will be considered a part of the Intermediary\u2019s performance record.  \nNote \nthat noncompliance with the reporting require ments is a violation of the loan agreement \nand/or grant award.  \n \nA. Database Registration  \n \nThere are three places where Intermediaries mu st register if they have not previously \nregistered with these databases.  SBA recommends completing these registrations in the following order.  \n1. Dun & Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number \n(www.dnb.com ) \nHow to register: DUNS numbers may be requested via the Web ( www.dnb.com ).  \nDUNS number assignment is free for all or ganizations required to register with \nthe Federal government for contracts or gr ants.  More instructions on requesting a \nDUNS number are available on grants.gov. (http://www.grants.gov/applic ants/request_duns_number.jsp\n) \n \n2. Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov ) \nHow to register:  Registration may be completed via the Web (www.ccr.gov ) and, \ndepending upon the size and complexity of your organization, it may take several days to complete and process your registration request. Because CCR is a \nfederally mandated program, there is no cost  for registrants.  Intermediaries using \nRecovery Act funds must maintain current  registrations in the CCR at all times \nduring which they are required to report through FederalReporting.gov.  Note that \na DUNS Number is required for registration in the CCR.  \n3.  FederalReporting.Gov (www.FederalReporting.gov)  \nHow to register: This website is OMB\u2019s online we b portal that will collect all \nRecovery Act recipient reports.   Reporting recipients mu st be registered as \nauthorized parties prior to submitting recipient reports on FederalReporting.gov .  \nIn order to register with FederalRepor ting.gov, Intermediaries  must already be \nregistered in CCR and must have a DUNS  number. According to the Recovery \nAccountability and Transparency Board (\u201c the Board\u201d), the registration process \nwill be available by August 17, 2009.   \n \nB.

The data quality review process  \n Following the submission of reporting information by Intermediaries by the tenth day after the close of the quarter, Intermediaries wi ll have ten additional days to review their \nsubmission in FederalReporting.gov to ensure it is both complete and accurate.  During \nthis time, SBA will also have \u201cview-only\u201d access to the reporting information.  At the conclusion of these ten days, Intermediaries will no longer be able to make changes to \ntheir submission.  SBA will have ten more days  to perform a data quality review of the \nIntermediaries\u2019 reports.  SBA will notify microlenders of any data anomalies or questions that need resolution.  If notified of quality  issues, the report will be unlocked and the \nIntermediary will have until the 29\nth day following the end of the quarter to complete any \nSBA-requested data corrections.  Detailed reci pient reports will be made available to the \npublic not later than thirty days afte r the end of each calendar quarter on \nhttp://www.Recovery.gov .  \n \n3.

PR IME will aid in researching and developing best \npractices in the field of microenterprise and technical assistance programs for disadvantaged \nmicroentrepreneurs. A minimum of  50 percent of the funds availa ble for grants under the PRIME \nAct must be used to benefit very low-income  persons, including those residing in Indian \nreservations.  All pertinent information on the PRIME progr am can be found by visiting Grants.Gov. Once \nlogged into Grants.Gov, click \u201cF ind Grant Opportunities\u201d. Sec ond, click \u201cBrowse by Agency\u201d. \nThird, click \u201cSmall Business\u201d. Within the search results, you\u2019ll find \u201cProgram for Investment in \nMicroentrepreneurs Act (PRIME)\u201d; follow that specific link. A new page  will surface with a \nsynopsis and full announcement for the Program for Investment in Microentrepreneurs Act \n(PRIME). Estimated total program funding is five-million dollars ($5,000,000). Award amounts may vary, \ndepending upon availability of funds (and performance for option years); however, no single grantee may receive more than $250,000 or ten (10) percent of the total f unds made available for \nthis program in a single fiscal year, whichever is less. In general, ma tch is required, although SBA \nmay reduce or eliminate match in certain circum stances (up to a program limit of 10 percent).  \nThe period of performance for this grant is one base year with four (4) twelve-month options \nsubject to availability of funds. The total possible period of performance is five (5) years. Each \noption year will constitute a separate budget period. The project recipient\u2019s satisfactory \nperformance will be one of the key factors in dete rmining the award of an option year. Failure to \nsecure the required annual non- Federal contribution during any project year may jeopardize \ncontinued option year funding.  \nApplications will be first screened  to determine if the applicant m eets certain mandatory eligibility \nrequirements. Applicants that do not document in their application that they meet these \nrequirements will not be evaluated by SBA for participation in the PRIME program. Eligible proposals will be scored by an Objective Review  Committee (ORC) based on specific evaluation \ncriteria.  \nEXPIRES:   PAGE 1 of 1 \nSBA Form 1353.3 (4-93) MS Word Edit ion; previous editions obsolete \nMust be accompanied by SBA Form 58 \nFederal Recyling Program   Printed on Recycled Paper ", "doc_id": "2970493b-03fb-40b6-9891-358e9e713f53", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ca8bbd123a0ce6e25b42cb51b4e8d6a207a7659e0a2ab50597b83700b8dc3de4", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HZZQIbcSxqnzk_ne8CqcvNIVvth4YinU/view", "title": "bank_5000-1117_0.pdf", "page": 0}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2895}, "relationships": {"1": "9de9449c-1c45-4070-91fb-eb65e6e2be00"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "51daa7b3-2e9f-49f1-9d4c-a9c6c398841c": {"__data__": {"text": "PAGE 2 of 2 EXPIRES:   \nSBA Form 1353.3 (4-93) MS Word Edit ion; previous editions obsolete \nMust be accompanied by SBA Form 58 \nFederal Recyling Program   Printed on Recycled Paper  \nUpdated 9/22/2009 The Objective Review Committee will consist of SB A officials and may include Federal Officials \nfrom other agencies.

(81 FR 41423) This modification streamlines, \nseparates , and distinguishes  the rules for small busine ss applicants in  the Business Loan, \nDisaster Loan and Surety Bond Guarantee Programs (\u201cSBG\u201d)\n from the rules for government \ncontracting, business development and ot her programs . The revised regulations governing \naffiliation for the Business Loan, Disaster L oan and SBG Programs are located at 1 3 CFR \n\u00a7121.301(f)  and will be effective July 27, 2016.  \n \nFor purposes of this rule, the Business Loan Programs consist of the 7(a) Loan Program, the \nMicroloan Program, the Intermediary Lending Pilot Program (\u201cILP\u201d), and the Development \nCompany Loan Program (\u201c504 Loan Program\u201d). The Disaster Loan Programs consist of Physical \nDisaster Business Loans, Economic Injury Disaster Loans, Military Reservist Economic Injury \nDisaster Loans, and Immediate Disaster Assistance Program  loans.  \n \nThe following summarizes the contents of the new regulations set forth at 13 CFR \u00a7121.301(f):  \n \n\u2022 Affiliation Based on Ownership, \u00a7121.301(f) (1). SBA will deem that control exists based \non ownership when a person owns or has the power to control more  than 50% of the \nvoting equity of a concern. I f no one person owns or has the power to control more than \n50% of the voting equity of the concern, SBA will deem the Board of Directors or President  or Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the concern (or other of ficers, managing \nmembers, partners, or directors who control the management of the concern) to be in control of the concern. \n \n \nSBA will deem a minority shareholder to be in control if that individual or entity has the ability, under the concern\u2019s charter, by -laws, or shareholder\u2019s agreement, to prevent a \nquorum or otherwise block action by the board of directors or shareholders . \n Formerly, SBA required the aggregation of the ownership interests of multiple minority shareholders , or two or more owners whose holdings are equal but less than 50% to \ndetermine control when no person owns 50% or more of the voting stock.  Instead, the new rule simply determines control to the Board and/or company officers when there is not a majority shareholder with voting rights .  \n  SBA Information Notice \n \n \n \n", "doc_id": "738dc62a-40fe-4bc8-8608-a5481741d26d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c3175dafcbbe7538783db7bd159baf0309dc9f8b65372dcdece8f38a4a479a6e", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vtZe_9PLluQ92vAoHX7mbPCLGucCTmXo/view", "title": "5000-1388_Affiliation_1.pdf", "page": 0}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2782}, "relationships": {"1": "1305214d-0a73-4943-8ded-c3bf4b32cbfc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "921a11fc-bce0-44d8-9887-855ed2f6a4e1": {"__data__": {"text": "PAGE 2 of 3 EXPIRES:  7/1/17  \nSBA Form 1353.3 (4- 93) MS Word Edition; previous editions obsolete  \nMust be accompanied by SBA Form 58 \nFeder al Recy cling Program   Printed on Recycled Paper \u2022 Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible securities, and agreements to merge , \n\u00a7121.301(f)(2).

Details on the types of management agreements that \nresult in determinations  of affiliation will be provided in SBA  Loan Program \nRequirements.    \n \n\u2022 Affiliation based on identity of interest, \u00a7121.301(f)(4).

SBA has limited \nthe franchise or license agreem ent reviews to the applicant franchisee or licensee and the \nfranchisor. No review will be  conducted for size based on affiliation for any franchise or \nlicense relationship of an affiliate of the applicant.  (Note: this does not remove the \nrequirement to det ermine size based on sales, receipts or employees for the applicant and \nall affiliates.)   \n SBA does not consider that franchise or license relationships create affiliation, provided, that the franchisee applicant  has the right to profit from its efforts an d bears the risk of \nloss commensurate with ownership. Details on the determination of the franchisee/licensee\u2019s right to profit from its efforts and bear the risk of loss commensurate with ownership will be provided in SBA Loan Program Requirements. \n Forme rly SBA required review of all franchise agreements of all franchises owned by the \nfranchisee, not just the applicant agreement.  \n \n\u2022 Determining the concern\u2019s size , \u00a7121.301(f)(6) .  In determining the concern's size, SBA \ncounts the receipts, employees (\u00a7121.201), or net income and net worth ( the alternate size \nstandard ), if applicable , of the concern whose size is at issue and all of its domestic and \nforeign affiliates, regardless of whether the affiliates are organized for profit.  \n ", "doc_id": "921a11fc-bce0-44d8-9887-855ed2f6a4e1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d00f2547c9d8aa014bfd2e0983acb0e9de41481b6c146735f979e01d314773a7", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vtZe_9PLluQ92vAoHX7mbPCLGucCTmXo/view", "title": "5000-1388_Affiliation_1.pdf", "page": 1}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3051}, "relationships": {"1": "48c7104a-90a0-4abd-a040-5d7f7653cae5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "22c836a2-f236-480b-9e56-a74f20ab5ceb": {"__data__": {"text": "EXPIRES:   7/1/17  PAGE 3 of 3 \nSBA Form 1353.3 (4- 93) MS Word Edition; previous editions obsolete  \nMust be accompanied by SBA Form 58 \nFederal Recyling Program   Printed on Recycled Paper \u2022 Exceptions to affiliation , \u00a7121.301(f)(7 ).

The \ndeclared disaster areas may be found at http:// www.sba.gov/disaster .   \n \nTo further support these recovery efforts, the Agency w ill provide  relief to certain borrowers , \nincluding SBA Microlenders,  with existing 7(a), 504, 7(m)  and disaster loans.   Effective \nimmediately, the Agency is providing an automatic 12 month  deferment of principal and interest \npayments for SBA -serviced  business and disaster loans  that were in \u201cregular servicing\u201d status on \nAugust 25, 2017 , in those primary counties designated as Federal disaster areas.  Interest will \ncontinue to accrue on the loans involved.  Borrowers will be notified of the automatic d eferment \non their monthly payment notices (SBA Forms 1201).  Borrowers preferring to continue making \nregular payments during the deferment period should notify their respective SBA servicing \ncenter to make alternative payment arrangements.  After this automatic 12 month  deferment \nperiod, SBA will review borrower circumstances on a case -by-case basis to determine the nature \nand extent of further relief appropriate for each situation.    \n \nBorrowers that are located in counties /parishes  contiguous to the  primar y county in the  disaster \nareas and have suffered an adverse impact because of the disaster  may be eligible for 9 month s \nof deferment of principal and interest payments on SBA -serviced business and disaster loans.  \nSBA will not automatically provide deferme nts on these loans, but an adversely impacted \nborrower in one of the identified contiguous counties /parishes  may request a deferment through \nthe SBA office servicing the loan.  SBA will evaluate these requests on a case -by-case basis, and \nmay provide defer ments when the borrower can show it needs such relief as a result of the \ndisaster.   SBA loan servicing personnel in these areas sh all advise borrowers experiencing \ndifficulty in making their loan payments that they may request deferment of these payments.   \n \nSBA is also strongly encouraging 7(a) Lenders , Certified Development Companies ( CDCs)  (as \nwell as third party lenders that provide the private sector financing for 504 projects ), and \nMicrolenders  to provide similar deferment relief for borrowers with lender  or CDC -serviced  \nSBA -business  loans in the primary disaster areas and contiguous counties /parishes .  District \noffices and servicing centers  shall advise  lenders of the need to accommodate borrowers \nadversely affected by  the events of Hurricane Harvey .  Since many SBA -guaranteed loans are \nsold in the secondary market, it is also important to note that 7(a) Lenders can provide one 90 \nday deferment without requesting approval from the secondary market purchaser.

The federal government has \nadopted the use of DUNS numbers to keep track of how \nfederal grant money is dispersed.  \nAsk your grant administrator or chief financial officer to \nprovide your institution's DUNS number. Research \nuniversities and most colleges, independent libraries, and \nlarge institution s already have DUNS numbers.  \nIf your institution doesn't have a DUNS number, call the \nspecial Dun & Bradstreet hotline at 1 -866-705-5711 to \nreceive one free of charge.  \nMore information about DUNS numbers is available at :  \nhttp://fedgov.dnb.com/webform .

Ask \nyour chief fi nancial officer, grant administrator, or \nauthorizing official if your institution  is already registered \nwith SAM.  \nRemember that registration with the System of Award \nManagement must be confirmed each year for your \nGrants.gov registration to remain valid.  \nIf your institution  is not registered, you can register online at \nwww.sam.gov  or apply by phone  at:   \n866-606-8220 . \nWhen your institution  registers with SAM, you must \ndesignate:   \n1)  SAM Point of Contact (SAM POC).

Email: HQ.OSBDC@sba.gov   \n \n1.2 Introduction   \nSBA seeks to make grants under the SBDC P ortable Assistance Project to SBDC Lead \nCenters serving economically distressed areas.  Projects under this award must provide \ntechnical assistance and/or training services to small businesses in communities that \nare economically impacted as a result of a recent business or government facility down -\nsizing or closing, known as a \u201cQualifying Event.\u201d  The Qualifying Event(s) must \ndemonstrate negative impacts of job losses or small business instability in the SBDC \nService Area.  The goals and objectives of a su ccessful application must demonstrate \nan increase in small business success and viability through such measures as job \ncreation and retention, increases in sales, business starts, and capital infusion.  \n \nSBA is particularly interested in collaborative effor ts (community, regional, statewide, \nindustry sector, etc.) that may serve as best practices and models of such small \nbusiness assistance.  Applicants are encouraged to design and develop innovative \nprograms and services to address the purpose of this Proje ct.  Portable Assistance \nprojects must be aimed generally at helping current and prospective small businesses in \nan area affected by a Qualifying Event, with a scope of work comprising a general \nproject to boost entrepreneurship in the affected area.  Effo rts funded under this \nannouncement may also produce products and methodologies that can be replicated by \nSBDCs in other locations nationwide.  \n \n1.3 Background   \nSince its inception in 1953, SBA has served to aid, counsel, assist and protect the \ninterests of small businesses.  While SBA is best known for its financial support of small \nbusinesses through its lending programs, the Agency also plays a critical role in  \nproviding funding to organizations that deliver technical assistance in the form of \ncounseling and training to small business concerns and nascent entrepreneurs in order \nto promote growth, expansion, innovation, increased productivity and management \nimpro vement.  The mission of SBA\u2019s Office of Small Business Development Centers \n(OSBDC),  which bears responsibility for administering the Portable Assistance  \nProgram, is to provide assistance to the small business community by linking the \nresources of federal, state and local governments with the resources of the educational \ncommunity and the private sector.  In partnership with SBA\u2019s OSBDC and district \noffices, the SBDCs develop programs and provide business management and other \nservices that enhance the econom ic development goals and objectives of their \nrespective  states, their local funding partners and SBA.

L. No. 106 -102 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901 note). The PRIME Act \nauthorizes the SBA Administrator to establish a program for the purposes of: (i) providing training and \ntechnical as sistance to disadvantaged entrepreneurs; (ii) providing training and capacity building \nassistance to microenterprise development organizations (MDOs) and programs; (iii) aiding in Research \nand development of best practices for microenterprise and technical  assistance programs for \ndisadvantaged entrepreneurs; and (iv) for other activities as the SBA Administrator determines.  \nThis year, SBA will give additional consideration to those applicants that (1) provide training and \ntechnical assistance to economicall y disadvantaged entrepreneurs in rural areas; and (2) training and \ntechnical assistance to support entrepreneurship in HubZones.  \n \n1.3 Background  \nSince its establishment in 1953, SBA has served to aid, counsel, assist and protect the interests of \nsmall business es.

The second email will indicate whether the \napplication has been successfully validated by the system and assigned an SBA tracking number, or has \nbeen rejected due to errors. An Applicant will receive a third email once SBA has downloaded its \napplication from grants.gov for review.

Email: Stanley.jonesjr @sba.gov  \n   \n1.2 Introduction \nThe overarching mission of the Office of Government Contracting and Business Development \n(\u201cGC  BD \u201d) is to assist small businesses to compete for Federal prime contract s and to secure \nsubcontracting opportunities from large businesses. Within the GCBD - , the Office of Business \nDevelopment's (BD\u2019s) specific mission is to execute activities authorized under Sections 8(a) and 7(j) \nof the Small Business Act . Under the former, SBA provides  business development assistance to firms \nthat are owned and controlled by economically and socially disadvantaged individuals.   Section 7(j) of \nthe Small Business Act authorizes the U.S. Small Business Administration ( \u201cSBA\u201d) to provide \nmanagement and technical assistance to eligible individuals and businesses.   \nTo be eligible for 7(j) services, a client must be:  a socially and economically disadvantaged individual \nwhose firm is a participant in the 8(a) Business Development Program; a business that is eligible to \nreceive 8(a) contracts; or a business which qualifies as small under 13 CFR subpart 121 \u2013 Small \nBusiness Size Regulations ; and that is located in an urban or rural area with a high proportion of \nunemployed or low -income individuals, or which is owned by such low -income individuals.  The \nterm \u201chigh proportion of unemployed\u201d means the urban or rural county's unemployment rate is not \nless than 140 percent of the average unemployment rate for the United States or for the State in \nwhich such county is located, whichever is less, based on the most recent data available in the  annual \nLocal Area Unemployment Statistics report from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor \nStatistics.  The term \"low -income individual\" means an individual whose family's taxable income for \nthe preceding year did not exceed 150 percent of the po verty level amount established by the Bureau \nof the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce, for determining poverty status.  \n As a component of BD, the Office of Management and Technical Assistance (\u201c OMTA \u201d) \nimplements the authority that section 7(j) of the Small Business Act (the \u201cAct\u201d ) vests  with SBA to \naward contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to private organizations to pay all or part of the \ncosts of services and projects that provide managemen t and technical assistance to eligible concerns.  \nAnnually, the 7(j) program reaches thousands of eligible businesses located throughout the United \nStates and its territories.  \nThe interstices of Sections 7(j) and 8(a) of the Act are filled in/   by SBA reg ulations found at Title 13 \nof the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 124.  These rules further define the purpose of \nthe 7(j) management and technical assistance program and define eligible recipients as individuals or \nconcerns eligible for assista nce under sections 7(a)(11), 7(j)(10), or 8(a) of the Act.

This \nprogram offers business development assistance to over 9,000 small government contractors that, in \naddition to meeting other criteria, are certified by SBA as owned and controlled at least 51% by \nsocially an d economically disadvantaged individuals.   \n \nAs a component of BD, the Office of Management and Technical Assistance (OMTA) implements \nthe authority that section 7(j) of the Small Business Act vests with in SBA to award contracts, grants, \nor cooperative agr eements to private organizations to pay all or part of the costs of services and \nprojects that provide management and technical assistance to 8(a) program participants and other \nsocially and economically disadvantaged businesses, businesses located in area s of high \nconcentrations of unemployment or low -incomes, and businesses owned by low - income individuals.  \nAnnually, the 7(j) program reaches thousands of eligible businesses located throughout the United \nStates and its territories.  \nFor over four decades, these services have been secured from professional service providers, \neducational institutions, non -profit organizations and private corporations.  Strategies employed have \nincluded business counseling in marketing, capture, financial and infrastructure ma nagement  \ndelivered through training seminars and webinars, executive education programs and other delivery  \nmethods, including directed, or \u201con -call,\u201d services.  Legacy services have been consistent with the \nSection 7(j)(l) non -exclusive list of categories eligible for funding, including : accounting, production \nand engineering; international trade; feasibility studies/market analyses/advertising; government \ncontracting assistance, specialized services, financial counseling, business plan assistance,  \nconstruc tion management; management training; loan packaging, computer programming services, ", "doc_id": "25b6fa8c-4337-4bae-98f0-4493a936c975", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0bba1042069cddbfd0f069fc4d29ab5568c7dbfc34a0f145624242a1c690e9bf", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OIzzR7E3-EJ_HN9KwpSsbE5zSAVoFeNE/view", "title": "Funding Opportunity Announcement.7j Grants.2018 FINAL.pdf", "page": 5}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3567}, "relationships": {"1": "0f96ab1b-a82e-441f-8df9-ed5f42afc00c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "67e0c883-df26-4e47-93e2-546123b78417": {"__data__": {"text": "U.S. Small Business Administration  \n    Office of Business Development  \n7(j) Management and Technical Assistance Program  \nFunding Opportunity No.  GCBD -7j-2018-01 \n \n \nPage | 7  \n data processing services, service contracts, seminars and workshops; and assistance in obtaining and \nincreasing bonding levels.   \n As a policy driven by funding limitation s and the goal of maximizing Return on Investment (ROI), \n management and technical assistance funded under this authority has been targeted primarily to 8(a) \n participants.

The program was \nexpanded and made permanent in 2007 when the WBC Sustainability Grant Program, established in \n1999, was replaced with the WBC Renewal Grant Progr am.  \n1.3 Background  \nSince its inception in 1953, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has served to aid, counsel, assist \nand protect the interests of small businesses.  While the SBA is best known for its financial support \nof small businesses through its m any lending programs, the Agency also plays a critical role in \nproviding funding to organizations that deliver technical assistance in the form of counseling and \ntraining to small business concerns and nascent entrepreneurs in order to promote growth, \nexpa nsion, innovation, increased productivity and management improvement.   \nThe mission of the WBC Program is to act as the catalyst for providing in -depth, substantive, \noutcome -oriented business services to women entrepreneurs, both nascent and established \nbusinesses, a representative number of which are socially and economically disadvantaged.  This \nmission is accomplished through the award of financial assistance to private, 501(c) - certified non -\nprofit organizations to enable them to affect substantial econ omic impact in their communities, as \nmeasured by successful business start -ups, job creation and retention, and increased company \nrevenues.

The program was \nexpanded and made permanent in 2007 when the WBC Sustainability Grant Program, established in \n1999, was replaced with the WBC Renewal Grant Progr am.  \n1.3 Background  \nSince its inception in 1953, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has served to aid, counsel, assist \nand protect the interests of small businesses.  While the SBA is best known  for its financial support \nof small businesses through its many lending programs, the Agency also plays a critical role in \nproviding funding to organizations that deliver technical assistance in the form of counseling and \ntraining to small business concern s and nascent entrepreneurs in order to promote growth, \nexpansion, innovation, increased productivity and management improvement.   \nThe mission of the WBC Program is to act as the catalyst for providing in -depth, substantive, \noutcome -oriented business serv ices to women entrepreneurs, both nascent and established \nbusinesses, a representative number of which are socially and economically disadvantaged.  This \nmission is accomplished through the award of financial assistance to private, 501(c) - certified non -\nprofit organizations to enable them to affect substantial economic impact in their communities, as \nmeasured by successful business start -ups, job creation and retention, and increased company \nrevenues.

If you work for or consult \nwith multiple organizations and have a profile for each, you may log in to one Grants.gov \naccount to access all of your grant applicat ions.   To add an organizational profile to your \nGrants.gov account, enter the DUNS Number for the organization in the DUNS field while \nadding a profile. For more detailed instructions about creating a profile on Grants.gov, refer \nto: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/add -profile.html  \n \n5. EBiz POC Authorized Profile Roles:   After you register with Grants.gov and create an \nOrganization Applicant Pro file, the organization applicant's request for Grants.gov roles and \naccess is sent to the EBiz POC. The EBiz POC will then log in to Grants.gov and authorize the \nappropriate roles, which may include the AOR role, thereby giving you permission to \ncomplete a nd submit applications on behalf of the organization. You will be able to submit \nyour application online any time after you have been assigned the AOR role.

For each funding opportunity announcement (FOA), yo u \ncan create individual instances of a workspace.  \nBelow is an overview of applying on Grants.gov. For access to complete instructions on how \nto apply for opportunities, refer to:  \nhttps://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/workspace -overview.html  \n1.

The program was \nexpanded and made permanent in 2007 when the WBC Sustainability Grant Program, establis hed in \n1999, was replaced with the WBC Renewal Grant Program.  \n1.3 Background  \nSince its inception in 1953, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has served to aid, counsel, assist \nand protect the interests of small businesses.  While the SBA is best known f or its financial support \nof small businesses through its many lending programs, the Agency also plays a critical role in \nproviding funding to organizations that deliver technical assistance in the form of counseling and \ntraining to small business concerns and nascent entrepreneurs in order to promote growth, \nexpansion, innovation, increased productivity and management improvement.   \nThe mission of the WBC Program is to act as the catalyst for providing in -depth, substantive, \noutcome -oriented business servic es to women entrepreneurs, both nascent and established \nbusinesses, a representative number of which are socially and economically disadvantaged.  This \nmission is accomplished through the award of financial assistance to private, 501(c) - certified non -\nprof it organizations to enable them to affect substantial economic impact in their communities, as \nmeasured by successful business start -ups, job creation and retention, and increased company \nrevenues.

Research \nuniversities and most colleges, independent libraries, and \nlarge institution s already have DUNS numbers.  \nIf your institution doesn't have a DUNS number, call the \nspecial Dun & Bradstreet hotline at 1 -866-705-5711 to receive \none free of charge.  \nMore information about DUNS numbers is available at :  \nhttp://fedgov.dnb.com/webform .

An application funded with the\nrelease of federal funds through a grant award does not constitute or imply compliance with\nfederal statute and regulations. Funded organizations are responsible for ensuring that their\nactivities comply with all applicable federal regulation requirements.\n10. Standard Term - Executive Pay\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Pub. L.116-94) signed into law on December 20,\n2019, restricts the amount of direct salary to Executive Level II of the Federal Executive Pay\nscale. The Executive Level II salary per E.O. 13756, was increased to $199,300 effective January\n2021.\nThe law limits the salary amount that may be awarded and charged to SBA assistance\nagreements and cooperative agreements. Award funds may not be used to pay the salary of any\nindividual at a rate in excess of Executive Level II. This amount reflects an individual\u2019s base salary\nexclusive of fringe and any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of the\nduties to the applicant organization. This salary limitation also applies to\nsubawards/subcontracts under an SBA grant or cooperative agreement.\n11. Standard Term - Non-federal Entity Responsibilities\na.

What is the legal authority for the SVOG Program? \nThe details of the SVOG program, as amended by the American Rescue Plan Act in March 2021, can be \nfound at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 9009a. \n2. What is an \u201celigible entity\u201d for an SVOG ? \nEligible entities may be live venue operators or promoters, theatrical producers, live performing arts \norganization operators, museum operators, motion picture theat re operators  or owners , and talent \nrepresentatives , per the Economic Aid Act . Additionally, entities of these types owned by state or \nlocal governments (for example, museums or historic homes) are eligible to apply if the government-\nowned entity acts solel y as a venue operator, museum, etc. and does not engage in other types of \nactivities.  \n \nFor example, a city parks and recreation department that operates a bandstand and separately \noperates various nature parks could apply as an eligible entity for the bandstand, but could not \ninclude the nature park entities.  \n  Finally, each subsidiary business owned by an eligible entity that also meets the eligibility \nrequirements in its own rights could apply  as an eligible entity.  \n3. When does a business have to have been established to be eligible to apply  for an SVOG?  \nThe business must have been in operation  as of February 29, 2020.  \n \n4. Is an entity that did not have revenue in 2019 but was conducting business operations on \nFebruary  29, 2020, eligible to apply  for an SVOG?  \nYes, if an entity did not have revenue in 2019 but was conducting business operations on Feb ruary  29, \n2020.

Is an entity  that applied for a First Draw or Second Draw PPP loan on or after Dec ember 27, \n2020, eligible to apply  for an SVOG?    \nYes. However, under the law, entities will be ineligible for a PPP loan AFTER they receive an SVOG .  \n \n7. If an entity applied for a PPP loan after the American Rescue Plan Act became law but before the PPP application form was updated, is it still eligible for an SVOG even though the PPP \napplication included a certification saying the entity would not apply for an SVOG?  \nYes.

How will receiving a PPP loan affect an eligible entity\u2019s SVOG award?  \nPer the American Rescue Plan Act, any entity that receives a PPP loan on or after Dec ember . 27, 2020 \n(whether First Draw or Second Draw) , will have the PPP loan amount deducted from the  SVOG  \namount. (If the entity received both a First Draw and Second Draw PPP Loan after December  27, 2020, \nthe combined amount will be deducted from the SVOG.)  \nFor example, if a jazz club receive d a PPP loan for $10,000 on February  1, 2021, and then applied for \nand received an SVOG which, based on the amount of its earned revenue loss would have been \n$100,000, the jazz club\u2019s  SVOG will be reduced by $10,000 and it will receive a $90,000 SVOG . Any PPP \nborrower that received a PPP loan before December  27, 2020, however, will not have the PPP loan \namount deducted from any subsequent SVOG. \n  \n9. If a portion of my PPP loan was forgiven, will that affect how much of the loan amount is \ndeducted from my SVOG? \nNo. The full amount of any PPP loan received on or after December  27, 2020, must be deducted from \nan entity\u2019s SVOG without regard to whether a portion of that PPP loan was forgiven or not.

Can a mobile, portable, or touring facility be a qualifying venue for an SVOG?  \nYes. Any venue, including traveling tent shows such as circuses and festivals, that meets all the \nrelated requirements in the Economic Aid Act (e.g., defined performance and audience spaces, \nlighting rig, etc.) will be considered an SVOG-qualifying venue.  \n \n11. Is a venue  with no fixed performance space eligible to apply?  \nNo. Venues must have defined performance and audience spaces.

If an entity is part of a private university, how will the SBA apply the  SVOG eligibility  barrier \nthat prohibits organizations which received more than 10% of their 2019 gross revenue from Federal  funding?  \nIf a private university owns less than a majority of an eligible entity with separate legal existence, the entity only needs to consider whether more than 10% of its own 2019 gross revenue came from Federal funding.  \n If a private university-based e ligible entity lacks separate legal existence from its parent university, or \nhas separate legal existence but is majority owned  or controlled\n by the university, it will have to look \nto the gross revenue of its parent university when determining whether it passes the barrier against \nhaving more than 10% of its 2019 gross revenue come from Federal  sources (excluding disaster \nassistance ).  \n \nNOTE: Public university -based eligible entities are not subject to the 10% cap on the Federal share of \ntheir gross revenue because they are owned by state or local governments.   See FAQ #20 in this \nsection  below.  \n \n15. If a no n-profit foundation\u2019s principal business activity is soliciting donations for a museum or \nlive venue operator or promoter, is that foundation eligible?  \nNo. Under such an arrangement the foundation\u2019s principal business activity  would be serving as  a \nfiscal agent for the university -owned museum or live venue operator or promoter rather than acting \nas a museum operator or live venue operator or promoter as is required by the Economic Aid Act.  \n \n16. For private college and university -owned entities seeking eligibility, does the 10% F ederal \nfunding barrier include financial aid that is awarded to students such as Pell grants?  \nYes. Based upon the treatment given Pell grants by the Department of Education, they would be \nincluded in the amount of Federal funding provided to college and university -owned entities that do \nnot have separate legal existence.  \n \n17. Are eligible entities owned by public universities, including municipally -owned colleges, \nconsidered government -owned eligible entities for the SVOG program? \nYes. Eligible entities owned by public universities will be subject to all the same restrictions and exceptions as other government-owned entities.  \n \n18. If a university owns and operates two eligible en tities that are not separate legal entities from \nthe university, but are managed by two different university departments with their own budget \nlines and professional staffing (though their budgets roll up into the larger university system \nbudget and staff members are university employees), may the two eligible entities each apply \nfor an SVOG if they meet all the required criteria? \nOnly if it is a public university  (see FAQ #32 in this section ). If the university is a private institution, it \nwould be subject  to the restriction against the submission of multiple applications under a single EIN. \nIn that case, both entities would have to be combined into a single application submitted under the \nuniversity\u2019s EIN.  \n ", "doc_id": "eee009c4-4122-4f61-a8b8-8d1fa2f132a8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c08bc35b833780d4187cc9925f133bc9e4f14005b520ec1e38d5a53aa1e471d6", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wwo2kgc2zvG8zBHwrwswRdzKqkix63GK/view", "title": "10-20-21 SVOG FAQ FINAL_508_final.pdf", "page": 3}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3464}, "relationships": {"1": "91846b4b-941c-482e-b105-931f8fc461a3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "37c7959d-3b48-4c6e-8601-f28336cee711": {"__data__": {"text": "5 | Page19.

Requiring these types of eligible entities  to exclusively use qualifying venues would fail  to \nrecognize  the reality of live performing arts industry business operations and lead to the extreme \nresult of the SBA e xcluding otherwise eligible entities for  something as slight as hav ing used a single \nnon-qualifying venue . As such, the SBA has interpreted the Economic Aid Act  to require a promoter, \ntheatrical producer, live performing arts organization, or talent representative to use qualifying \nvenues for a majority  of the events  (more than 50%) they stage  or book  clients into .  \n \n28. If an entity qualifies under two different categories of eligible entities (for example, a museum \nand a live venue operator) which category should be used when applying? If an entity can meet all the requirements for more than one type of eligible e ntity\n, it is recommended \nthe entity pick the entity type that gives the strongest case for eligibility or that best represents its \nprincipal business activity.  \n \n29. What is \u201c de minimis gross revenue\u201d from the sale of products or services , or presentation of any \nmaterials of a prurient sexual nature that allows an entity to be eligible for an SVOG?  \nIn applying this re striction imposed by  the Economic Aid Act, the SBA is follow ing longstanding \nAgency practice from its financial assistance programs  and hold ing that  5% or less is a de minimis \namount of gross revenue.  \n \n30. If an entity receives state funding that originated from the F ederal government, does this count \ntoward the 10% eligibility threshold for revenue from the F ederal government? \nYes, unless that funding originated as F ederal disaster assistance . \n \n31. What types of T ribal ly-owned entities are eligible to apply?  \nThe Economic Aid Act does not include T ribes in its definitions of states or political subdivision s of \nstates, which are both permitted to own eligible entities . However, the Act\u2019s definition of \u201crelevant \nmuseum operator \u201d references section 273 of the Museum and Library Services Act (20 U.S.C. 9172) , \nwhich  specifically includes Tribal museums. As such, Tribal ly-owned museums are the only Tribally -\nowned entities  eligible for SVOGs.  \n \n32. Because government -owned eligible entities generally operate as divisions of T ribal, state, or \nlocal governments and do not have their own EINs or separate legal existence, will the SBA look to the governmental owners of such entities for purposes of determining the principal business \nactivity?  \nNo, the SBA examine the principal business activity  of the applying  itself and not solely  consider the \noperations of its owner, even where the entity uses the EIN of its  government -owner  or parent \ncompany .  \n ", "doc_id": "e6091d4d-b442-4da7-839b-18f2efcea598", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "020e66045c06467ebdc4c09c2c830f81076c7731eb4dc5906f8551171a05f091", "extra_info": {"source": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wwo2kgc2zvG8zBHwrwswRdzKqkix63GK/view", "title": "10-20-21 SVOG FAQ FINAL_508_final.pdf", "page": 5}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3639}, "relationships": {"1": "ca0639d7-78d3-4613-9a34-598d8ed91ba1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c3df9e8-8177-48b3-842a-88d6ef6f9c72": {"__data__": {"text": "7 | Page  33.

Can  an entity with no staff or payroll qualify for the program?  \nYes. For example, an entity such as a promoter or talent representative that operates as a sole \nproprietorship or single member LLC with no employees could be eligible for an SVOG. In such a case, it would use its SVOG funding for non-payroll costs such as the payment of rent, utilities, scheduled \ndebts, maintenance fees, taxes, etc.  \n \n35. If an SVOG -related business was previously owned or operated by an ineligible entity (for \nexample, a movie theatre owned by a national chain listed on a stock exchange) but has since \nbeen sold or otherwise transferred to an owner or operator that does meet the eligibility \ncriteria could the transferred business serve as the basis for, or be included in, an SVOG \napplication?  \nYes. The SBA will determine SVOG eligibility as of the date an entity submits its application for the \nprogram. The fact that a venue, theater, etc. was previously owned or operated by an ineligible \norganization will not affect an applicant\u2019s eligibility.  \n \n36. How did the SBA determine tha t to be eligible for SVOG assistance an entity could not do \nbusiness in certain identified countries ? \nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which includes the Economic Aid Act , states that SVOG \nfunds may not be obligated or expended to directly finance  any assistance or reparations for the \ngovernments of Cuba, North Korea, Iran, or Syria.  In addition, the United States has imposed \nsanctions on these four nations th rough  the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets \nControl which  cover  things such as financial and trade transactions with  entities, institutions, and \nindividuals within their borders.  \n \nMuseum or Movie Theat re Operator \n37. Are motion picture theatre owners eligible to apply?  \nYes.

Is a museum or movie theatr e with a multipurpose room with movable seating eligible? \nNo, if the only auditorium or room  in the museum or movie theatre has temporary, removable, \nmodular, convertible, or other non-fixed seating arrangements , it would not be eligible . The \nEconomic Aid Act specifically requires museums and motion picture theatre s have \nfixed audience \nseating . In order to qualify for SVOG, a pplying museums and motion picture theatres must have  at \nleast one room with fixed audience. \n NOTE:  There is no fixed audience seating requirement for other types of eligible entities.  \n 39.

If a museum has more than one qualified auditorium, theat er, performance or lecture hall, or\noutdoor amphitheater, does regular programming need to occur in each, or is it sufficient to\nhave regular programming within all the qualifying presentation spaces?\nA museum may aggregate programming across all such spaces for purposes of meeting the regular\nprogramming requirement rather than looking at  each qualifying presentation space individually  if a\nmuseum has multiple qualifying presentation spaces (auditoriums, theaters, performance or lecture\nhalls, or outdoor amphitheater s).\n43. What happens if a motion picture theatre is owned by one entity, but operated (managed) by a\nseparate entity? Are both entities eligible for an SVO G in such a case?  If so, what will the earned\nrevenues of the two companies be based upon?Yes. Under the Economic Aid Act, owners and  operators of motion picture theatres are considered\neligible entities.\nIn cases where both the owner and the operator of a qualifying motion picture theatre separately\napply for  SVO G, each will base its earned revenues upon its share of those payments received as a\ncondition of its ownership or operation of the motion picture theatre. This could include but  is not\nlimited to space rental, ticket sales, management fees, digital projection reimbursements, and othernon-gratuitous payments or transfers  as allocated by contract, lease, or other formal legal\nagreement.

Is a landlord who owns a shopping center that includes a mo vie theat re eligible to apply for an\nSVO G given they \u2018own or operate\u2019 an eligible motion picture theatre?\nIt is not likely. Because a shopping center owner\u2019s principal business activity  \nwould most likely be\nowning or operating a shopping center rather than owning or operating a motion picture theatre, it is\ndoubtful it would be eligible for an SVOG.\n45. To qualify as regular  programming, does the programming provided in a museum\u2019s theater\nneed to be ticketed and open to the general public?No.\n46.

If the provision of food and drink are incidental to regular live performing arts activities, such\nas a jazz or comedy club, the enti ty may be eligible to apply. However, if the  principal line of business\nis restaurant operation rather than live venue operation , the business would not be  eligible to apply\nfor an SVOG .\n50.

Is a performing arts center owned and operated by a government or state college (as a college\ndepartment) eligible to apply ?\nYes.\n52. Is an air show operator eligible to apply?\nNo. The live venue operator or promoter definition under the Economic Aid Act requires an entity toeither put on performing arts events at qualifying venues or sell advance tickets to performing arts\nevents at qualifying venues. While an air sh ow is a form of live entertainment, it does not constitute a\nperforming art. As such, air show operators do not qualify as live venue operators or promoters.\n53.

D\noes a ticket broker or reseller qualify as a live venue operator or promot er?\nNo\n. The Economic Aid Act\u2019s live venue operator or promoter definition requires an entity to have as\nits principal business activity  either:\n(1) Organizing, promoting, producing, managing, or hosting events by performing artists for\nwhich admission fees are charged and performers are paid based on a percentage of sales,  a\ngu\narantee, or other mutually beneficial formal arrangement; or\n(2) Publicly selling tickets on average 60 days in advance of performing arts events for whichperformers are paid based on a percentage of sales, a guarantee,  or other mutually beneficial\nformal arrangement.\nWhile ticket brokers or resellers do deal in tickets to performing arts events and may do so 60 days in \nadvance, performers are not paid from these transactions. Furthe r, as one of their commonly used \nnames implies and because they operate in the aftermarket, ticket brokers or resellers may be viewed not as being principally in the business of selling tickets, but instead as being principally in \nthe business of reselling them. As such, ticket brokers or resellers do not meet the criteria found in \nthe definition of live venue operator or promoter.  \n58. W\nhat criteria will the SBA apply when determining whether a particular form of liv e\nen\ntertainment constitutes a performing art s event for an SVOG?\nThe SBA believes p erforming arts as related to the SVOG program means events such as musica l\nc\noncerts, comedy shows, theatrical productions, dance performances, or other live renderings of\nsimilarly artistic works.

For all other purposes, an entity may rely \nupon either the accrual or cash method of accounting ; SBA recommends applicants use the same \naccounting method used for their Federal Tax Return.  \n \n142. Can  government -owned eligible entities receive funds  during the first or second priority \nperiods?  \nNo. The first and second priority periods are designed to assist the eligible entities that have faced \nthe most significant losses while having limited means to make up for lost revenue. Tribal, state,  and \nlocal governments have access to taxpayer funds and other resources which private individuals or \norganizations lack.  \n143. How will the SBA prioritize applications within each priority period? Will it be on a first-\ncome, first -served basis or will it be based on the size of the percentage of revenue loss \nsuffered?  \nWithin each priority period and the non-priority p eriod, the SBA will process applications in the order \nin which they were received.  \n \n144.

T he SVOG statute allows  grantees to  use award funds for \n\u201cordinary and necessary business expenses.\u201d  Based on the IRS definition in Publication No. 535, an \nordinary and necessary business expense is \u201c\u2026 one that is common and accepted in your trade or \nbusiness. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your trade  or business. An \nexpense does not have to be indispensable to be considered necessary.\u201d  Alcohol sales often form a \nsubstantial portion, if not the majority, of the earned revenues for many SVOG grantees , especially \nvenu e operators and motion picture theatr e operators. Accordingly, purchasing alcohol as a supply \nor inventory is a n ordinary and necessary business expense for such grantees .  \nHowever, using SVOG funding to purchase alcohol for use as entertainment or personal expense is \nunallowable in accordance with the governmentwide grant regulations  in 2 CFR 200.423. For \nexample , grantees could not use their grant funds to send bottles of champagne to their clients or \nprovide martinis at a reception or any similar situation involving the purchase of  alcoholic beverages.

How should an entity determine its number of full -time equivalent employees ?  \nFor employee count, the SBA is drawing on the Economic Aid Act\u2019s specific provisions re: the \ncalculation of employees  and  decades of agency experience in counting employees under the SBA \nsize regulations (13 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.106).  \n \nEmployees that work  at least 30 hours per week  are considered full-time. Employees that work \nbetween 10- 29 hours per week  are considered one- half of a full -time employee. E mployee s that work \nless than 10 hours per week are not considered an employee. Once the qualifying employees are \ndetermined , an entity must then calculate the average number of employees it had  over the prior \nyear by adding up the number of qualifying employees in each individual pay period and dividing that \namount by the number of pay periods over the 12 -month period from March  1, 2019 to February  29, \n2020.  \nFor example, assume a firm paid its employees monthly  and had the following number of qualifying \nemployees each pay period:  \n\u2022 Mar  2019 \u2013 9.5 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Apr 2019 \u2013 8 full -time employees  \n\u2022 May 2019 \u2013 9.5 full-time employees  \n\u2022 Jun  2019 \u2013 8.5 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Jul 2019 \u2013 10 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Aug  2019 \u2013 10 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Sep  2019 \u2013 7 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Oct 2019 \u2013 8.5 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Nov  2019 \u2013 7 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Dec  2019 \u2013 6 full -time employees   \n\u2022 Jan 2020 \u2013 7.5 full -time employees  \n\u2022 Feb  2020 \u2013 6 full -time employees  \n \nThe sum of the firm\u2019s full- time employees is 97.5.

For determining employee counts and the average number of employees, what should an \nentity do if the date range doesn\u2019t match neatly with the payroll schedule  (e.g., biweekly)?  \nAn entity\u2019s average number of full -time employees will be determined with reference to each pay \nperiod that falls, either in whole or in part, within the 12-month timeframe stipulated by the Economic Aid Act.  \n For example, if an entity\u2019s biweekly pay period ran from February  18, 2019, to Mar ch 3, 2019, that pay \nperiod would be considered when determining the entity\u2019s number of full -time employees, even \nthough only three days of that pay period fell within the 12-month timeframe.

The SBA will consider the totality of the circumstances, including criteria used by the IRS for Federal \nincome tax purposes, in determining whether individuals are employees of a concern.

What does it mean for two or more entities to be affi liated?  \nAffiliation occurs where one firm has the power to control another firm, or a single person or entity \nhas the power to control both. Affiliation typically arises due to common ownership, management, or \nthrough contractual or other legal arrangement s. The SBA uses the principle of affiliation to help it \ndetermine if an entity is eligible for some government program or benefit reserved for small businesses. Where firms are found to be affiliated with one another, the SBA will combine their \nrevenues and number of employees and compare those aggregated amounts to the relevant size \nlimit for the program or benefit one of the firms is seeking. In this way, the SBA ensures that a firm \nwhich appears to be small but is actually controlled by a large corporation does not take a benefit meant only for small firms. The rules regarding affiliation in the context of SBA\u2019s financial assistance \nprograms may be found at 13 C.F.R. \u00a7121.301(f).  \n \n209. How will the SBA apply the principle of affiliation to the SVOG program? \nIn administering the SVOG program, the SBA will consider the principle of affiliation in the following \ntwo contexts:  \n(1) In applying the two provisions of the Economic Aid Act that specifically reference affiliation.   \nFirst, it says affiliated firms (including subsidiaries) may apply for SVOGs on their own if they meet all the eligibility requirements. Second, it says that no more than five affiliated firms may receive SVOGs. In applying these two provisions, the SBA will rely upon the general \nprinciples of 1 3 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.301(f) to determine when firms are affiliated.  \n(2) In determining whether an entity  qualifies for the small employer set -aside  or is subject to the \ncertification regarding protecting labor rights.

In allocating revenues and expenses to the separate entities the owner should consider the roles and responsibilities of each entity and the effort and other resources each contributed to the \nconsolidated operations and ensure that any such division is reasonable and well documented. \n 217. If a company has 10 subsidiaries or affiliates that are independent legal entities could all 10 \napply for an SVOG at once with the understanding that only five of them could receive grants? \nNo. Any applications received above the five affiliated -entity limit will be rejected without being \nevaluated.

For example, could a concert hall and a movie theatre owned by the same parent entity each use that parent entity\u2019s EIN to apply?  \nYes.  \n \n219. When will the SBA consider two entities with common ownership to be affiliated for \npurposes of the SVOG program? \nConsistent with the affiliation regulations for financial assistance programs  (see 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n121.301(f)) the SBA will consider two firms to be affiliated based on ownership  for purposes of the \nSVOG program where one firm owns more than 50% of the other o r a single person or entity owns \nmore than 50% of both.  \n \n220. Can 2 or more firms affiliated due to their common ownership by another firm apply jointly?  \nWhile affiliates may apply  for the SVOG program  in their own name or may be included in an \napplication subm itted by their ultimate parent entity, they cannot team up together on an \napplication unless one of the firms owns more than 50% of the other.  \n For example, if Company A owns 100% of Company B, which owns 100% of Company C, then \nCompany C could apply in its own name or be included in either A or B\u2019s application. Conversely, if \nCompanies B and C are both 100% owned by Company A then they could each apply in their own \nname or be included in A\u2019s application , but B and C could not pair up together to submit an SVOG \napplication.  \n \n221.

Can affiliated entities use the same SAM registration to apply for up to five SVOGs or should \neach affiliated entity that desires to receive a SVOG individually obtain its own SAM \nregistration? With the exception of T ribal, state,  or local government -owned eligible entities , which as previously \nnoted typically do not have their own EINs and thus will also lack their own SAM registration, each \nentity applying for an SVOG must use its own SAM registration.  \n 224. If an entity is disregarded for tax purposes and doesn\u2019t file its own tax returns, should the \ndisregarded entity apply for an SVOG or should the entity that files tax returns apply for the SVOG? \nAssuming both entities have their own separate legal existence,  and each meets the eligibility \nrequirements under the Economic Aid Act, either could apply for an SVOG.  \n225. Can the same email address be used for registering several affiliated eligible entities  that \nwill be applying for SVOG awards?  \nNo. Separate email addresses must be used for each entity that registers with  the SVOG Application \nPortal.  \nAppeals \n226. Why is  the SBA allowing for an a ppeals process in the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant \nprogram? The agency recognizes that the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program\u2019s eligibility requirements \nare complex as written in the statute, and that a lack of familiarity with the federal grants process \nmay have resulted in some applicants submitting incorrect or insufficient information to prove their \neligibility. The agency would like to provide additional process for these applicants who are eligible \nunder statute to attempt to prove their eligibility.
